# Cloud Native Development Patterns and Best Practices

## Preface

* AWS, NodeJS, Serverless Framework, HighlandJS streaming library (3)
* Diagrams created using Cloudcraft (5)

## Chapter 1: Understanding Cloud Native Concepts

* Disposable infra is key to speed, safety, and scale (12)
* Bounded components follow single responsibility principle (14)
* Bounded components service requests from local materialized views (15)
* "What, really, wow": running UI tier without any servers (16)
* Pushing more (API, security, caching, storage) to the edge of cloud (16)
* Why does model need to properly reflect domain? When talking to domain experts, easier to reason about (17)
* Leverage native cloud services, even if proprietary, over deploying open source solutions (18)
* Concerns of vendor lock-in are monolith thinking; leverage value-add services, and you can replace the component later (19)
* Polyglot cloud (running on multiple cloud providers) is inevitable, as competition builds niches with competitive advantages (20)
* Multicloud strategies will not pan out, as they require upfront abstractions/complexity & fail to leverage provider's strengths (21)
* Decoupling deployments frmo releases (24)
