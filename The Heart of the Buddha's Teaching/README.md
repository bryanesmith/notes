* "For a table to exist, we need wood, a carpenter, time, skillfulness, and many other causes... The wood needs the forest, the sunshine, the rain, and so on. The carpenter needs his parents, breakfast, fresh air, and so on... If we continue to look in this way, we'll see that nothing has been left out. Everythin in the cosmos has come together to bring us this table. Looking deeply at the sunshine, the leaves of the tree, and the clouds, we can see the table." (222)
* Seeing the causes in the effects and the effects in the causes is **interdependent co-arising**, which is Right View. (225)
* When the seeds of awakening, love, and compassion in store consciousness have been developed and matured, store consciousness is transformed into the **Great Mirror Wisdom** that reflects the reality of all that is. (239)
