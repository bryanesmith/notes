## Silicon Control Rectifier (SCR), aka Thyristor

Type of **control diode** (diode used to regulate current flow or voltage)

**SCR** is the General Electric (GE) name for a **thyristor**

Rectifier consisting of alternating P-type and N-type semiconductor materials (PNPN)

Three electrodes: anode (A), cathode (C), gate  (G)

**Adjustable Gate Control** regulates how much SCR conducts

**Holding current**: minimum amount of anode current must flow to keep in "on" state

Once threshold current flows through gate, allows forward flow of electricity (as long as meets holding current)

Three modes: 
1. reverse blocking (unidirectional)
2. forward blocking
3. forward conducting

Common uses: 
* light bulb dimmers (more efficient than variable resistor)
* variable-speed drives
* conveyor belts (smooth acceleration/deceleration)
* pressure control systems
* controlled rectifier circuits (e.g., power supplies), stable output voltage

Pros: (1) longevity (solid-state devices with no moving parts), (2) handle significant power levels, (3) energy efficient
