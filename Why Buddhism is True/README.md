# Why Buddhism is True
Robert Wright

## 1. Taking the Red Pill

* One of Buddha's main messages: pleasures we seek soon evaporate, leaving us wanting for more (5)

* Pleasure fading is a feature of evolution (7-8)

* **The Four Foundations of Mindfulness**, an ancient text on objects of meditation (12)

## 2. Paradoxes of Meditation

* Author's breakthrough: focusing on tension in jaw, and no longer identifying with the feeling (20-1)

## 3. When Are Feelings Illusions?

* Feelings designed to encode judgments about things in our environment (29)

* One type of delusion: obsolete urges (e.g., craving donuts, raging) (30-2)

* Second type of delusion: false positives (e.g., mistaking stick for snake; fearing steps behind you being mugger; feature of offending others; painful self-consciousness) (30-5)

* Meditation as a process of dispelling illusions (39)

* Recap of our delusions: feelings not designed to depict reality accuratly; modern world doesn't match the "natural" environment; happiness delusion (40-1)

## 4. Bliss, Ecstacy, and More Important Reasons to Meditate

* **default mode network**: network of brain active when not doing anything in particular (45)

* Concentration meditation can lead to powerful feelings of bliss or ectasy (47-8)

* Mindfulness vs concentration meditation (49)

* Mindfulness meditation is what will sharply alter our perceptions (54-5)

* **Vipassana** (insight) meditation (56)

## 5. The Alleged Nonexistence of Your Self

* Cannot understand non-self through intellectualizing alone (58)

* **Discourse on the Not-Self** (60-2)

* Two properties of the self found to be absent: control and persistence (63)

## 6. Your CEO Is MIA

* The conscious mind isn't in control; so what is? (77)

* Split-brain experiments demonstrate that we deceive ourselves into thinking we have control (78-9)

* Subliminal imagry impacts motivation (80)

* Evolutionary benefit of self-delusion: others trust confidence (82-3)

* **beneffectance**: people naturally present themselves as beneficial and effective (83)

* Various studies showing people overrate their competence, morality, contributions, and their self-awareness of their personal bias (83-4)

* The conscious brain is essentially a brain component responsible for public relations (86)

* **Modular model of the mind**: highly distributed, overlapping; helps explain the struggle we have with self-control (86-9)

## 7. The Mental Modules That Run Your Life

* **intertemporal utility function**: aka time discounting; willingness to delay gratification for high future payoff (91)

* Pictures of opposite sex change time discounting (93)

* Moods determine which submodule controls self - then what's the same "you" from moment to moment?

* Feelings trigger modules; it isn't consciousness that's in control. Highlights two fundamental aspects of Buddhism: nonattachment & nonself

* How jealousy triggers submodules with evolutionary benefits (96-8)

* When mate-acquisition module activated, 1) crow-averse, 2) time discounting recalibrated (bias towards near-term), 3) career goals more materialistic. There are evolutionary reasons for all of this. (98-100)

* Buddhism & science agree: there is no single self that runs the show; there are multiple selfs that seize control through feelings (104)

## 8. How Thoughts Think Themselves

* Default mode network & minds wandering during meditation (107-8)

* The mind isn't wandering as much as consciousness is being commandeered by modules (109)

* Joseph Goldstein, Sharon Salzberg, Jack Kornfield cofounded the Insight Meditation Society, which focuses on Vipassana teachings (110)

* When meditating, imagine each thought is coming from someone else (110-1)

* Thoughts arise and the mind has a strong habit to identify with them; the conscious mind doesn't create thoughts - it receives them (112)

* We get caught up in our thoughts, forgetting their essentially insubstantial nature (113)

## 9. "Self" Control

* Whether or not we buy something is more of a contest between conflicting feelings than exercise of ration thought (122-3)

* Parts of brain mediating physical pain also mediate pain of social rejection (125)

* Self-discipline is actually the positive and negative reinforcement of modules (132-4)

* **RAIN technique**: to fight an urge: (135)
  - Recognize the feeling
  - Accept the feeling
  - Investigate the feeling (and its relationship to body)
  - Nonidentification/Nonattachment

* Mindfulness is the ability to deprive the modules of the positive reinforcement that has given them power (139)

## 10. Encounters with the Formless

* Our perceptions of reality are based on stories upon stories; e.g., we treat things as bad because we imagine the forfeited opportunity as good; or we believe something is bad without really knowing the long-term consequences (151-2)

## 11. The Upside of Emptiness

* **Capgras delusion**: being convinces someone (usually close) is an imposter, perhaps due to disruption between visual and emotional regions of brain (153-5)

* Perhaps we identify things in a complex way involving emotion? (154-5)

* Humans are automatic evaluators, even of mundane objects (159-61)

> ... the machinery in my mind that assigns feelings to things was originally designed to maximize genetic proliferation. That it no longer reliably does this is among the absurdities of being a human (162)

* Hypothesis: feelings infuse things w/ essence, and meditating dampens this (163)

* Does emptiness lead to dampening of emotion, or other way around? (164)

* The entire infrastructure of feelings should be viewed with suspicion, given its aim is to spread genes and not foster clear perception and thought (164-5)

* All our experiences come with a story, which can mislead us. E.g., study showing wine connoisseurs more likely to praise wine with premium label than table wine, even when the same wine (166)

* Shedding "emotionally laden, I-me-my thoughts" (167)

* Yale medical school study showing Gary Weber's default mode network was quiet - even prior to meditation (167)

## 12. A Weedless World

* **fundamental attribution error**: tendency to give biased explanation of people's using dispositional or situational factors (176)

* Given this bias, is it possible that character traits like honesty, benevolence, friendliness are illusions? (177)

* **Domain-specific psychological mechanisms**: replacement term for 'modular view of the mind' due to misconceptions around the word 'modular' (182)

* Our mind doesn't "color" our perceptions; it creates them. There's no unbiased view available. (182-3)

* **metta mediation**: loving-kindness meditation. Directing loving-kindness towards self, and others, including enemies (185-6)

## 13. Like, Wow, Everything is One (at Most)

* How microbes influence the mind (197)

* Three poisons: raga (greed), dvesha (hatred), and moha (delusion) (212-3)

## 14. Nirvana in a Nutshell

* The human brain is a machine designed by natural selection to respond reflexively to sensory input. If you observe these feelings mindfully rather than reacting to them, you can escape the control, getting close to the "unconditioned" (219-20)

* Buddhist philosophy consists of taking causality really, really seriously (222)

## 15. Is Enlightenment Enlightening?

## 16. Meditation and the Unseen Order

* Author's vivid meditative experience of seeing his inner critic (247-8)

* Author's occasional ability to control the experience of bliss (249-250)

* Thinking of enlightenment as a gradual process, not a sudden achievement (253-4)
