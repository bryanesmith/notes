# Run Fast. Eat Slow.

Shalane Flanagan & Elyse Kopecky

## Tldr

* eat more healthy fats; some questionable claims about coconut oil
* despite what many athletes believe, it's not just macronutrients that matter; vitamins & minerals also matter
* certain foods like grass-fed dairies help w/ muscle recovery (CLA) and are anti-inflammatory
* claims natural sweeteners better b/c less processed, mineral rich, lower glycemic load; but elsewhere I read that these benefits are marginal, and most sweeteners have 50/50 splits of fructose and sucrose

## Chapter 1: Eat Slow to Run Fast
* runners need more antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals than most people
* inflammatory foods like refined grains, processed sweeteners, industrial oils, artificial ingredients
* hydrogenated fats are inflammatory, and lead to weight gain instead of energy

## Chapter 2: Our Pantry
* homemade broths are nutrient-rich, anti-inflammatory
* coconut oil helps w/ fat-soluble vitamin absorption & is highly usable energy source
* dates are high in glucose for quick energy, and high in minerals
* raisins are high in iron and vitamin b
* whole grains are rich in vitamin b
* butter from grass-fed cows source of conjugated linoleic acid (CLI), which helps muscles recover faster
* home-made sports drink: freshly-squeezed orange juice, coconut water, water, salt
