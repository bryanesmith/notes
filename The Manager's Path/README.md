# The Manager's Path
Camille Fournier

## 1. Management 101

### Feedback and Workplace Guidance
* Good managers know that delivering feedback quickly is more valuable than waiting for a convenient time to say something. (4)

### Training and Career Growth
* Your manager holds some responsibility for helping you find training and other resources for career growth. (5)

### Spend Time Thinking About What You Want
* As you go through various stages of your career, you’ll start to realize how much uncertainty there is in the world. (7)

* Use your manager to discover what’s possible where you are, but look to understand yourself in order to figure out where you want to go next. (8)

### You Are Responsible for Yourself
* Your manager cannot force work–life balance on you. (8)

* Sometimes you will have to go against the cultural grain to set your own boundaries (8)

### Give Your Manager a Break
* Your relationship with your manager is like any other close interpersonal relationship. The only person you can change is yourself. (9)

* Especially as you become more senior, remember that your manager expects you to bring solutions, not problems. (9)

## 2. Mentoring

### Mentoring a New Hire
* Mentoring new hires is critical. Your job as a new hire mentor consists of onboarding, helping this person adjust to life in the company effectively, and building your and her network of contacts in the company. (17)

* Effective teams have good onboarding documents they provide to new hires. (17)

* Bringing this person into some of your networks will help her get up to speed faster, and it will give you a new entree into whatever networks she ends up forming and joining in her time with the company. (18)

* It’s very difficult to build a career at any company with multiple teams without building a strong network of trusted people to share information and ideas with. (18)

* You may be an introvert, or someone who does not find socializing easy, but conscious effort and practice in getting to know new people and helping them succeed will pay off. (18)

### Good Manager, Bad Manager: The Alpha Geek
* The alpha geek tries to create a culture of excellence, but ends up creating a culture of fear. (20)

* Are you eagerly seeking out the gotcha, hunting for mistakes, reluctant to admit that someone else has had a good idea or has written good code? (21)

* You tend to see alpha geeks in the CTO role at technology-focused startups, where they are given a design and development focus across from an execution-focused Vice President of Engineering. (21)

### Tips for the Manager of a Mentor
* What you measure, you improve. As a manager you help your team succeed by creating clear, focused, measurable goals. (22)

* “emotional labor” (22)

### Tips for the Manager of a Mentor
* Emotional labor is a way to think about traditionally feminine “soft skills”—that is, skills that address the emotional needs of people and teams. (22)

### Make Connections
* Your career ultimately succeeds or fails on the strength of your network. (25)

## 3. Tech Lead

* My job as tech lead was to continue to write code, but with the added responsibilities of representing the group to management, vetting our plans for feature delivery, and dealing with a lot of the details of the project management process. (28)

* However, tech leads will be working on one major new technical skill: project management. The work of breaking down a project has a lot of similarity to the work of designing systems, and learning this skill is valuable even for engineers who don’t want to manage people. (29)

### All Great Tech Leads Know This One Weird Trick
* From now on, wherever you go in your career, balancing (31)

* Is likely to be one of your core challenges. (31)

### Software developer and team leader
* Teams often fail because they overworked themselves on a feature that their product manager would have been willing to compromise on. (33)

### Managing a Project
* Project management is the act of breaking a complex (38)

* End goal down into smaller pieces, putting those pieces in roughly the most effective order they should be done, identifying which pieces can be done in parallel and which must be done in sequence, and attempting to tease out the unknowns of the project that may cause it to slow down or fail completely. (38)

* As things slip (and they always do), keep everyone apprised of the status. (39)

* Run a premortem, an exercise where you go through all the things that could fail on the launch of this big project. (39)

### Good Manager, Bad Manager: The Process Czar
* My other piece of advice is to look for self-regulating processes. If you find yourself playing the role of taskmaster—criticizing people who break the rules or don’t follow the process—see if the process itself can be changed to be easier to follow. (46)

## 4. Managing People

### Build Trust and Rapport
* One strategy is to ask a series of questions that are intended to help you get to know the aspects of the person that impact your ability to manage him well. These questions might include: (50)

### Create a 30/60/90-Day Plan
* Help their new reports create a 30/ 60/ 90-day plan. (51)

* Having a clear set of expected goals for your new hires that you believe is achievable in the first 90 days will help you catch mis-hires quickly (51)

### Encourage Participation by Updating the New Hire Documentation
* One aspect of onboarding will likely include contributing to the team’s onboarding documentation. (51)

### Communicate Your Style and Expectations
* If the new hire doesn’t know what you expect from him, he can’t deliver what he needs to deliver. This expectation setting on your part should include specifics (52)

### Get Feedback from Your New Hire
* Get as much feedback as you can about the new hire’s perspective on the team in that first 90 days. (52)

### Scheduling 1-1s
* The default scheduling for 1-1s is weekly. I encourage you to start with weekly 1-1s and adjust the frequency only if both of you agree that this is more than you need. (53)

### The Catch-up
* Empathetic leaders can sometimes allow themselves to get sucked into an unhealthy closeness with their direct reports. If you start focusing a lot of energy on hearing reports’ complaints and commiserating, you’re quite possibly making the problem worse. (55)

### The Feedback Meeting
* Quarterly is frequent enough to give the topic attention without it feeling like all you talk about is career development. (55)

* If you have an employee with performance issues, feedback meetings should happen more frequently, and if you’re thinking of firing someone I advise you to document these feedback meetings. (55)

### The Progress Report
* When you get to the stage where you’re managing managers, a lot of your 1-1 meetings will be diving into details of projects they’re overseeing that you don’t have time to dig into on your own. (56)

### Good Manager, Bad Manager: Micromanager, Delegator
* Micromanagement creeps up on you. A high-stress project that can’t be allowed to slip seems at risk, and so you step in to correct it. (57)

* The hardest thing about micromanagement is that there are times when you need to do it. (58)

* Trust and control are the main issues around micromanagement. (58)

* Autonomy, the ability to have control over some part of your work, is an important element of motivation. (58)

* Delegation is not the same thing as abdication. When you’re delegating responsibility, you’re still expected to be involved as much as is necessary to help the project succeed. (58)

### Use the Team’s Goals to Understand Which Details You Should Dig Into
* Ask the team how they’re measuring their success and ask them to make that visible to you on an ongoing basis. (59)

### Gather Information from the Systems Before Going to the People
* The worst micromanagers are those who constantly ask for information they could easily get themselves. (59)

### Establish Standards for Code and Systems
* Developing basic standards as a team helps everyone communicate with one another in code and design reviews, and it depersonalizes the process of providing technical feedback. (60)

* Basic standards meant things like how much unit testing we expected to happen with each change (60)

* And at what point technical decisions should be reviewed by a larger group (60)

### Treat the Open Sharing of Information, Good or Bad, in a Neutral to Positive Way
* Isn’t to punish him with micromanagement for his failure to communicate status; teach Jack what he needs to communicate, when, and how. (60)

* In the long run, if you don’t figure out how to let go of details, delegate, and trust your team, you’re likely to suffer personally. Even if your team doesn’t quit, you’ll end up working longer and longer hours as your responsibilities increase. (61)

* If you were only allowed to work 45 hours this week, what would you do with those 45 hours? (61)

### Creating a Culture of Continuous Feedback
* The most important thing is that the team has adopted a culture of providing feedback frequently. (61)

* Build up those observational muscles. (62)

### Creating a Culture of Continuous Feedback
* If you spend most of your time trying to get people to correct weaknesses, you’ll end up with a style that feels more like continuous criticism. (62)

* Save your valuable coaching time for those who are receptive to it. (63)

### Use concrete examples, and excerpts from peer reviews
* If you can’t use a concrete example to support a point, ask yourself if the point is something you should be communicating in the review. Forcing yourself to be specific will steer you away from writing reviews based on underlying bias. (65)

### Spend plenty of time on accomplishments and strengths
* Don’t let people skip over the good stuff in order to obsess over the areas for improvement, as many will want to do. Those strengths are what you’ll use to determine when people should be promoted, (65)

### When it comes to areas for improvement, keep it focused
* What about the case where you have very little meaningful feedback for improvement? This indicates that the person is ready to be promoted or given more challenging work. (66)

### Schedule enough time to discuss the review
* Don’t let them skip over this and jump straight into the areas for improvement. Many people are uncomfortable being praised at length, but skipping that section undermines its value in reinforcing and encouraging their talents. (67)

* Expect it to be the hardest part of the review to discuss for anyone who got anything less than the top ratings. In my experience, people are uncomfortable being told they merely meet expectations, especially those who are early in their careers. Come prepared to dig into the reasons for this score, including examples of how the person could achieve a higher score. (67)

* Biases lead us to assume potential (67)

* Real potential shows itself quickly (68)

* Don’t confuse “potential” as it might be described by a grade-school teacher with the type of potential you care about. You are not molding young minds; you’re asking employees to do work and help you grow a company. (68)

### Cultivating Careers
* Many companies expect you to be acting at the next level before you get promoted to it. This practice exists to prevent the “Peter Principle” (70)

### Challenging Situations: Firing Underperformers
* **Performance improvement plan**. This is a set of clearly defined objectives that the person must achieve within a fixed period of time. (70)

* A final warning: don’t put anyone on a plan whom you wouldn’t be happy to lose. Most smart employees will take this formal warning as a sign that the organization is not a good fit for them, and leave as quickly as possible. (72)

## 5. Managing a Team

* As much as you may want to believe that management is a natural progression of the skills you develop as a senior engineer, it’s really a whole new set of skills and challenges. (75)

* They are capable of identifying headcount needs for the team and planning and recruiting to fill these needs. (75)

### Staying Technical
* As you progress in your career, even though you may stop writing code, your job will require that you guide technical decision making. (77)

* Technical instincts honed over years of doing the job are very important for guiding that process. (77)

* If you truly wish to command the respect of an engineering team, they must see you as technically credible. (77)

* It’s a struggle to figure out how to stay technical as you transition to management. (77)

* Why bother writing any code if all you’re doing is small stuff? The answer is that you need to stay enough in the code to see where the bottlenecks and process problems are. (78)

### Not Shipping
* Humans, by and large, feel good when they set small goals and meet them regularly. (79)

* As the manager of the team, you may worry about pushing them too hard, and so you let them miss deadlines without a fuss. The trick is to learn how to balance pushing your team and holding back. (79)

### People Drama
* Sometimes the negative person is just unhappy and the best thing to do is to help him leave the team on good terms; you must be prepared for this outcome. Other times, the person has no idea about the impact he’s having on the team, and a quick chat will be all that’s needed to curtail the incidents. (80)

* Be careful that vocally negative people don’t stay in that mindset on your team for long. (80)

### Unhappiness Due to Overwork
* My advice is to dedicate 20% of your time in every planning session to system sustainability work (“ sustainability” instead of the more common “technical debt”). (80)

* In a case where overwork is due to a pressing, time-critical release, remember two things. First, you should be playing cheerleader. (81)

* Second, do everything you can to learn from this crunch period and avoid it the next time. (81)

### Collaboration Problems
* You can make the situation worse by undermining your peers in front of your team, so even when you are frustrated with them, try to stay positive and supportive of their efforts in public. (81)

* Using your managerial power to override technical decisions is usually a bad idea. (82)

### The Shield
* So, yes, shielding your teams from distraction is important. Or, to put it another way, helping them understand the key important goals and focusing them on those goals is important. However, it’s unrealistic to expect that you can or should shield your team from everything. (83)

* The extreme shielders think they can best focus and motivate their teams by giving clear goals. But humans usually need some sort of context into why these goals have been set, and thereby into what problems they’re working to solve. (83)

* If you’re going to have operational issues in November if a particular system isn’t up and running, your team deserves to understand that consequence. (83)

* As the manager, it’s not your job to make all of those decisions by yourself. (83)

### How to Drive Good Decisions
* While the product manager is responsible for the product roadmap, and the tech lead is responsible for the technical details, you are usually accountable for the team’s progress through each of these elements. (84)

* The nature of leadership is that, while you may only have the authority to guide decisions rather than dictate them, you’ll still be judged by how well those decisions turn out. (84)

### Create a Data-Driven Team Culture
* Give that person data about team productivity (such as the time it takes to complete features) or data about quality measures (like how much time is spent dealing with outages, or the number of bugs found in QA or after releases). These efficiency and technical data points can be used to evaluate decisions on both product features and technical changes. (84)

### Good Manager, Bad Manager: Conflict Avoider, Conflict Tamer
* Conflict-avoidant managers tend to favor harmony above functional working relationships. (87)

### The Dos and Don’ts of Managing Conflict
* Your goal as a manager, however, should not be to be nice, it should be to be kind. (88)

* It’s kind to tell someone who isn’t ready for promotion that she isn’t ready, and back that up with the work she needs to do to get there. (89)

* It’s kind to tell someone that his behavior in meetings is disrupting the group. (89)

### Challenging Situations: Team Cohesion Destroyers
* The real goal here is psychological safety—that is, a team whose members are willing to take risks and make mistakes in front of one another. (90)

* When companies talk about hiring for “culture fit,” they often mean they want to hire people they can be friendly with. While this can have some unwanted consequences, such as discrimination, it comes from a wise place. (90)

### The Brilliant Jerk
* Once they’re hired, getting rid of brilliant jerks takes a level of management confidence that I think is uncommon. (91)

* The difficulty is, if she doesn’t see her behavior as a problem, she won’t change it. It’s unlikely that you alone will be able to convince her that her behavior is a problem. All the evidence in the world can’t change a person who doesn’t want to change. (91)

* The best thing you can do for your team, in the context of having a brilliant jerk, is to simply and openly refuse to tolerate bad behavior. (91)

* Keep the feedback neutral but to the point if you are going to deliver it in the moment, in public. Note that this approach should only be used for behavior you feel is detrimental to the whole group. If you just think the person is undermining you personally, discuss it in private. (91)

### The Noncommunicator
* The noncommunicator—the person who hides information from you, from his teammates, from his product manager. (91)

* Whatever the cause, this person disrupts team cohesion because he isn’t being collaborative with the rest of his teammates; he doesn’t feel safe sharing his work in progress, and his fear often sets an example for the rest of the team. (92)

### The Employee Who Lacks Respect
* The third type of toxic individual is the person who simply doesn’t respect you as a manager, or who doesn’t respect her teammates. (92)

* You can’t have a person working for you who doesn’t respect you, or doesn’t respect your team. (92)

### As you approach deadlines, it is your job to say no
* There will be times when the engineering team will say that they can’t possibly implement a feature without doing some other technical work, and you will need to figure out when to push for a hack implementation and when to hold back for the right implementation. (94)

* There will be product features that require significant engineering complexity to implement, and you’ll need to work with the product team to figure out the real must-haves while explaining the cost to get to their vision. (94)

### Use the doubling rule for quick estimates, but push for planning time to estimate longer tasks
* The popular doubling rule of software estimation is, “Whenever asked for an estimate, take your guess and double it.” This rule is appropriate and good to use when you’re asked for an off-the-cuff guess. (95)

### Be selective about what you bring to the team to estimate
* Try to get a teamwide process in place for talking about new features and customer complaints, and limit estimations that occur outside of this process. (95)

### Assessing Your Own Experience
* When was the last time you reviewed a completed project to see if it had achieved its goals? (98)

## 6. Managing Multiple Teams

* They are expected to own retention goals within their organization. (101)

* The risk of going hands-off is greatly amplified if you don’t spend enough time coding before moving into this role to get yourself deeply, fluently comfortable with at least one programming language. (101)

* Finally, even if you don’t intend to write much code, I strongly advise you to keep at least a solid half-day once a week completely free from meetings or other obligations, and try to use this time at least partially on some creative pursuit. (102)

* Almost everyone who goes from a heavily hands-on technical role into management has a transition period where they question frequently whether they’ve made a mistake. (102)

* Writing code is full of quick wins, especially for the experienced developer. (102)

* Management has fewer obvious quick wins, especially for new managers. It’s natural to feel some longing for simpler times (102)

### Managing Your Time: What’s Important, Anyway?
* Following up on task completion, can become one of the biggest time sinks and distractions in your day if you aren’t careful. (103)

* Understanding the difference between importance and urgency. (103)

* Urgency is often more clearly felt than importance. (104)

* It’s likely that you’re spending a lot of your time on things that are urgent but only slightly important, and sacrificing things that are important but not urgent. (104)

* Healthy meetings require involvement from all parties, and a culture that favors short but productive meetings requires that participants do some up-front work to come to the meeting prepared. (104)

* As a manager of multiple teams, you can win back a lot of time by pushing an efficient meetings culture down to your teams. (105)

* Ask for agenda items up front. (105)

* Meetings can fall into that urgent but not important category, and you may decide to simply not attend them where you’re not clearly needed. (105)

* During meetings, look around the room at your team and notice their engagement. If half of them are falling asleep, staring off into space, on their phones or laptops ignoring the proceedings, or otherwise disengaged, the meeting is wasting their time. (105)

### Decisions and Delegation
* When you get home you find yourself with no energy to decide what to eat for dinner, no energy for hobbies, and the desire to eat comfort food, drink a beer perhaps, and stare blankly at the computer or TV until it’s time to go to bed. (107)

* In my experience both going through this transition and managing people in it, if you don’t feel a little bit overwhelmed, you’re likely missing something. (107)

* Delegation is the primary way you claw yourself out of the feeling of having too many plates spinning at once. (108)

### Delegate Complex and Frequent Tasks to Develop Your Team
* If you teams can’t operate well without you around, you’ll find it hard to be promoted. Develop your talent and push decisions down to that talent so that you can find new and interesting plates to learn how to spin. (109)

### Challenging Situations: Strategies for Saying No
* But to create this environment, she sometimes must say no. She must say no to the team. She must say no to her peers. She must even say no to her boss. Each of these nos is hard, in its own way, and a strong manager must develop effective strategies for saying no. (111)

### “Yes, and”
* “yes, and” technique. Responding with positivity while still articulating the boundaries of reality will get you into the major leagues of senior leadership. (111)

### Don’t Prevaricate
* If you have the authority to say no, and you don’t believe something should happen, do yourself a favor and don’t agonize over the process. (113)

* You’ll be wrong sometimes, so when you discover that you were too quick to say no, apologize for making that mistake. (113)

### Technical Elements Beyond Code
* Assuming that the job at this level becomes essentially nontechnical is a mistake. (114)

* You now need to develop an eye for the technical health signals for the overall team. (114)

* First, Break All the Rules (114)

### Measuring the Health of Your Development Team
* When you’re focusing on the health of your development teams, put on your technical hat to design systems and processes that will keep things moving. Create the tools that developers need to do their jobs. Help them focus so they can easily figure out what needs to happen next. Interrogate every process to determine the value it should provide, and always ask yourself if it can be automated further. (115)

### Frequency of Releases
* I bet if you honestly take a look at a team that isn’t releasing frequently, you’ll see cracks. (116)

* Push for time away from the product roadmap to support increasing engineering productivity, and set goals for the team that inspire them to move faster. (116)

### Frequency of Code Check-ins
* If your company expects fast-moving product development, engineers who want to go off for weeks and write code alone without pushing it into shared version control will slow your team down and cause problems. You’re not managing a research team. (117)

### Frequency of Incidents
* When risk reduction turns into weeks of manual QA, excessive and slow code reviews, infrequent releases, or a drawn-out planning process, the increased analysis can leave developers idle and restless, without necessarily reducing the risk of incidents. (118)

### Good Manager, Bad Manager: Us Versus Them, Team Player
* They unite the team by emphasizing how this identity is special as compared to other teams. When they go too far, this identity is used to make the team feel superior to the rest of the company, and the team is more interested in its superiority than the company’s goals. (118)

* Shallow binding (119)

* Empire builders, seeking out opportunities to grow their teams and their mandates without concern for what is best for the overall organization. (119)

* As a manager, be careful about focusing on your teams to the exclusion of the wider group. (119)

* Durable teams are built on a shared purpose that comes from the company itself, and they align themselves with the company’s values (120)

* They have a clear understanding of the company’s mission, and they see how their team fits into this mission. (120)

* purpose-based binding (120)

### The Virtues of Laziness and Impatience
* What you want to teach them is how to focus. To that end, there are two areas I encourage you to practice modeling, right now: figuring out what’s important, and going home. (121)

* When you work later than everyone else, when you send those emails at all hours, even if you don’t expect your team to respond to those emails or work those hours, they see you doing it and think it’s important. And that overwork makes them less effective, especially at the detailed knowledge work that engineers need to perform. (122)

* And constantly ask yourself the same questions you ask your team: Can I do this faster? Do I need to be doing this at all? What value am I providing with this work? (122)

### Assessing Your Own Experience
* When was the last time you reviewed your schedule for things that you’re doing but that aren’t providing a lot of value for you or your team? (124)

## 7. Managing Managers

* This is a tough growth point. You’re going to be pulled in many directions, and figuring out how exactly to spend your time to maximize your leverage across your teams will be critical. In order to do this well, you’ll need to practice honing your instincts, and this practice will require you to follow through on things that you’re not sure are actually important, but you just sense are off. (125)

* However, as a first-timer in this role, you’re probably not going to detect problems until they’re far gone. You haven’t yet built up the discipline or instincts to let yourself intuitively sense where and when to dive in deep, so you need to do so more frequently, even when things seem to be going well. (126)

* People who are good at managing a single team, or even a couple of related teams, fall apart when asked to manage managers, or teams that are outside of their skill set. (126)

* They’re unable to balance the ambiguities inherent in their new role, and fall back into things that they find easy. (126)

* Sometimes it shows up as a person playing project manager instead of training their managers to do that job themselves. (126)

* Here, you need to follow up on all the little things until you figure out what you don’t need to follow up on. Is recruiting happening? Are your managers coaching their teams? Has everyone written up their goals for the quarter? Have you reviewed them? What is the status of that project that should be finishing up? That production incident that happened the other day—did the postmortem happen? Did you read the report? (126)

* One thing that managers have to keep in mind is that part of their job is to ferret out problems proactively. (127)

### Skip-Level Meetings
* Skip-level meetings are one of the critical keys to successful management at levels of remove. (128)

* Having people who manage up well in your organization is always a hard situation to detect and respond to. These individuals get to you first, so you hear their perspective before you hear anything else, and you’re predestined to think they’re in the right and to support their decisions. Skip-level meetings are a chance to hear the other side of the story, (130)

* You won’t get it perfectly right. There will still be times when you hear too late about a project that’s suffering, or a manager who’s failing his team, or a team member who’s causing problems for others. (130)

### Manager Accountability
* Whether you have experienced managers or first-timers reporting to you, there is one universal goal for these relationships: they should make your life easier. Your managers should allow you to spend more time on the bigger picture, and less time on the details of any one team. This is why they’re around. (131)

* This small piece of expertise—learning how to hold managers accountable—will be one of your biggest learning opportunities as you work at this level. (131)

* Despite the mitigating circumstances in each case, the manager ultimately needs to take responsibility for pulling the team out of these situations and getting them moving forward, because the manager is accountable for the health and productivity of the team. (132)

* When the product organization is constantly changing goals, the manager should identify that the changes are causing problems on the team, and work with product to explain the problem and refocus on what’s important. If that fails, she should come to you to help resolve the issue. (132)

* If the team can’t do anything but fight fires, the manager should put together a plan for tackling the causes of the fires, and if necessary bring requests for hiring more people or adding more people to the team so that they can get the situation under control. (132)

* The manager is responsible for triaging that support burden and figuring out whether to refuse some of the requests (132)

* This is what making your job easier looks like—not hiding information, but bringing you clear problems before they turn into raging fires. (132)

### Good Manager, Bad Manager: The People Pleaser
* people pleaser. He has a deep aversion to ever directly making people he cares about unhappy. (133)

* He’s more interested in having a team that runs smoothly and avoids mistakes than he is in getting the team to push themselves to really become excellent. (134)

* She overpromises and underdelivers, and never seems to be able to learn from this experience to promise less in the future. (134)

* Therapist people pleaser (134)

* Disappoints his team by making promises to them that he cannot possibly keep. (134)

* External pleaser. (134)

* She spends a great deal of energy managing upward and outward, and in particular tends to significantly overcommit her team. (134)

* One manager might insist on jumping on every single issue brought in front of the team and doing all of the tedious work of, say, resolving data problems that are due to bugs in the product. Because the manager doesn’t actually have the focus for this task, the issues are resolved slowly. (135)

* They may even be genuinely contrite when you provide corrective feedback, but it’s very hard for them to do things that visibly make others unhappy. And you probably like your people pleasers very much as people. They’re very nice! (135)

### Managing New Managers
* Spending quality time with your new managers is important, and you should expect this to be an up-front cost that pays long-term dividends for your organization. (136)

* Finally, that team is no longer your direct concern! Unfortunately, your new manager can be shockingly clueless as to even the basics. (136)

* When people start quitting because their manager hasn’t given them a career path or isn’t inspiring them, it’s ultimately your responsibility. Use skip-level meetings to help you detect areas where you need to support your new manager fully, and let her know that you’ll be holding skip-levels frequently as you help to guide her most effectively. (137)

* One common sign of a struggling first-time manager is overwork. A new manager who is working all the time is probably failing to hand off her old responsibilities to other people on her team, and so she’s attempting to do two jobs at once. (137)

* It’s amazing to me how many people never quite learn how to let go of tasks and so are just constantly working longer and longer hours. (137)

* Make it clear that you expect the new manager to hand off some of her old work, and help her identify opportunities to do so. (137)

* Overwork is also often a sign of another new manager danger: the person who thinks she’s now in control, the taskmaster of the team, responsible for making all of the decisions. (137)

* The control freak takes away the team’s ability to make any decisions and views her job as assigning specific work to people to be done. Control freaks usually have bad relationships with their peers in product management and other tech teams, because they often fight to make decisions alone instead of collaborating. (137)

* Sometimes new managers fail to realize that they are now responsible for this delivery, and believe themselves helpless in the face of challenging goals or product roadmaps. (138)

* Clearly set the expectation up front that you’ll hold her accountable for the team, and help her build the skills to achieve this. (138)

* Keep an eye on your new managers. You may need to provide not only coaching but strong corrective feedback in the first six months. (138)

* But managers create subcultures, and a manager who creates an incompatible subculture can be a problem if you want your teams to work together well. (139)

* Often we overvalue expertise in product areas and allow it to blind us to cultural and process fit with our companies and teams. (139)

* While they may not need as much training as new managers, experienced managers often need help expanding their network both within the company and externally, so look for programs that can help them meet new peers. (140)

### Hiring Managers
* The biggest difference between a management interview and an engineering interview is that managers can, theoretically, bullshit you more easily. (141)

* Any manager you hire should role-play a few 1-1s as part of the interview process. One of the best ways to do this is by asking the people who would report to the new manager to interview her by asking her to help with problems they have right now, or have had in the recent past. (141)

* A good manager—even without a full understanding of the people or projects involved—should have good instincts for questions to ask and suggested next steps that might improve matters. (141)

* Role-play other types of difficult situations, like dealing with an employee who is underperforming, or delivering a negative performance review. (141)

* Ask the manager to describe a time when she ran a project that was behind schedule, and what she did in that scenario. Or ask her to role-play with an employee who is thinking about quitting. Ask the manager to describe how she’s coached employees who were struggling, and helped great employees grow to new levels. (141)

* Ask her about her management philosophy. If she doesn’t have one at all, that might be a red flag. (141)

* What does she think the job of a manager is? How does she stay hands-on, and how does she delegate? (141)

* You might have a candidate come in and give a presentation to a group of people. The point of this is not specifically to judge the contents of the presentation, but to see how she is at commanding a room, answering questions posed by a group, structuring her thoughts, and getting up in front of an audience. These are skills that a senior manager should possess, and if she lacks those skills, take that into consideration when you’re deciding whether to hire her. I’d caution you not to overvalue this step, however. (141)

* Plenty of otherwise excellent managers are uncomfortable speaking in front of strange audiences. (142)

* You want to make sure that you get enough of a sense of a candidate’s technical skills that she’ll be able to establish credibility to the team she’ll be managing. (142)

* For a noncoding manager, ask technical questions that you believe she should be able to address given her experience. (142)

* Design and architecture questions based on the types of systems she’s built or managed are a good approach. Make sure she can discuss the tradeoffs that were made and why. (142)

* You might also have her mediate a technical debate between engineers who disagree on the solution to a problem. A good technical manager will know what kinds of questions to ask that tease out the core issues and guide the group to a solid consensus. (142)

* I’ve seen managers from big companies who treated their peers well but their underlings and other lower-level staff members like they were less than human, which caused massive friction in the startup space. I’ve also seen managers from startups who were used to being able to act on whatever they thought was most important struggle in environments that required more sign-off from other parties. (142)

* If you value servant-leadership and you hire a manager who wants to dictate exact marching orders to the team, there will be a bad fit. Similarly, if you value collaboration and hire a manager who thinks that the loudest voice in any conversation should win, you will also have problems. (143)

* Culture fit is so important in managers because they shape their teams to their culture, and they hire new people based on their cultural ideas. (143)

* High Output Management (143)

* His observation is that most new hires act in self-interest until they get to know their colleagues, and then they move into group interest. So, if you start them in a highly complex or uncertain job, they tend to fail unless they quickly settle into the cultural norms and use cultural values to align their decision making. (143)

* Do thorough reference checks for anyone you’re planning to bring on board, even if you’ve worked with that person before. (143)

* It’s tempting for managers who want to trust and delegate to simply assume that people will do the right thing and let them go, but this can easily result in you missing problems in these areas for far too long. (145)

* Make the time to get comfortable with each area; take time to get to know the manager and employees in the team, and practice asking for details about the area, so that you can start to learn and develop a sense for what the people in that team are actually doing. (145)

### Setting Expectations and Delivering on Schedule
* You must always be aggressive about sharing estimates and updates to estimates, even when people don’t ask, especially if you believe that the project is critical or likely to take longer than a few weeks. (149)

* Engineers often don’t want to estimate at all, or estimate beyond the boundary of an agile sprint (149)

### Challenging Situations: Roadmap Uncertainty
* Changes in strategy are where being stuck in “middle management” feels the most unpleasant. (151)

### Strategies for Handling Roadmap Uncertainty
* The calmer you can be in the face of these changes, and the better you can show (or fake) enthusiasm for the new direction, the easier the transition will be for your whole team. (153)

* When you are faced with waves, you can let them pull you under or you can learn how to surf. (153)

### Make Specific Requests
* Managers who don’t stay technical enough sometimes find themselves in the bad habit of acting as a go-between for senior management and their teams. Instead of filtering requests, they relay them to the team and then relay the team’s response back up to management. This is not a value-add role. (155)

### Use Your Experience as a Gut Check
* One major weak spot for managers is losing touch with the tools and processes for actually developing, testing, deploying, and monitoring code. These are the places where new ideas can make your teams significantly more effective. (156)

## 8. The Big Leagues

* You’re capable of making hard decisions without perfect information and willing to face the consequences of those decisions. (160)

* You’re capable of understanding the current landscape of your business, as well as seeing into its many potential futures. You know how to plan for the months and years ahead so that your organization is best suited to handle those potential futures and capture opportunities as they come along. (160)

* You can play politics in a productive way, in order to move the organization and the business forward. You work well with your peers outside of engineering and seek out their perspectives in addressing issues with a wide scope. (160)

* You know how to hold individuals and organizations accountable for their output. (160)

* Reminding people of their commitments by asking questions instead of giving orders. It’s hard for a leader of a large team to forcefully guide that team in any direction, so instead rely on nudging members of the team to keep the overall organization on track. (160)

* Making decisions is one of the most draining and stressful parts of the job. (161)

### What’s a VP of Engineering?
* The VP is usually at the top of the management career ladder for engineers. This generally means that the VP is expected to be an experienced manager of people, projects, teams, and departments. (164)

* As companies grow, it’s common for the VP-level role to change from an organizationally focused job to a business strategy position. These people often act as mini-CTOs for divisions, balancing strategy and management. (164)

* As the person in charge of the day-to-day operations of the team, a good VP of Engineering has a solid handle on processes and details. (165)

* Often a great VP of Engineering is described as having a good “ground game.” This person is capable of dropping into the details and making things happen at a low level. (165)

* The VP of Engineering job is both a big one and a detail-oriented one. This is one of the reasons it’s such a hard job to hire for, even though most companies will need to hire this role in from outside. (165)

* She’ll be heavily involved in helping teams set goals to achieve business deliverables, and that means she’ll need to be closely aligned with the product team. (165)

* The people I know who excel in this role are capable engineers who care deeply about their teams and prefer to stay out of the spotlight in favor of creating high-performing organizations. They’re interested in the complexities of getting people to work together effectively. They want their teams to be happy, but they know that it’s important to tie that happiness to a sense of accomplishment. (165)

### What’s a CTO?
* The CTO job is one of the least well-defined roles in the technical world. (166)

* CTO is not an engineering role. CTO is not the top of the technical ladder, (166)

* The CTO should be the strategic technical executive the company needs in its current stage of evolution. (166)

* First and foremost, a CTO must care about and understand the business, and be able to shape business strategy through the lens of technology. He is an executive first, a technologist second. (167)

* The CTO must understand where the biggest technical opportunities and risks for the business are and focus on capitalizing on them. If he is focused on recruiting, retention, process, and people management, that’s because it’s the most important thing for the technology team to focus on at the time. (167)

* The CTO must protect the technology team from becoming a pure execution arm for ideas without tending to its own needs and its own ideas. (167)

* It’s incredibly difficult to maintain influence and effectiveness as an executive with no reporting power. (167)

* You can’t give up the responsibility of management without giving up the power that comes with it. (168)

* My advice for aspiring CTOs is to remember that it’s a business strategy job first and foremost. It’s also a management job. (168)

* The fastest route to becoming a CTO is to be a technical cofounder, but that guarantees you the job only so long as you and the startup grow together. The fastest route to being a VP of Engineering is to get management experience at a larger organization and then join a growing startup. (169)

### Changing Priorities
* Leaders who are removed from the day-to-day schedules of the teams can forget that teams have long priority lists that may have been mapped out weeks or months ago and may take weeks or months to complete. (170)

* Saying something is top priority is one thing, but making the actual tradeoffs on the schedule to get people moving on it is completely different. (170)

* Most people need to hear something at least three times before it really sinks in. (171)

### Consider Your Board’s Communication Style
* This board needed a deck that was very dense with information. It’s not uncommon for company boards to read through the slide deck before a meeting, so that the meetings can be focused more on details than on presentations. (173)

* I like to describe technology strategy for product-focused companies as something that “enables the many potential futures of the business.” (174)

### Challenging Situations: Delivering Bad News
* As a person in senior leadership, you’ll need to excel at communicating sensitive information to large groups. (175)

* The worst way to communicate bad news is via impersonal mediums like email and chat, especially mediums with commenting abilities. (175)

* The second-worst way to deliver this message, especially to a large group that you know won’t be happy, is with them all in a room at once. You may think that trying to communicate bad news to everyone at once is the best way to keep it from spreading before everyone has heard it, but the result is still impersonal. (175)

* Try your best to talk to people individually about the news. (175)

* In a case where you need to get the message out to your whole organization, talk to your managers first, give them talking points, and then let them share with their teams before bringing the whole group together. (175)

* If you absolutely can’t deliver the news in a way that won’t betray your strong disagreement, you might need to have someone else help you deliver it. Perhaps you ask another executive to step in, or maybe someone from HR. (175)

* Try to bring solutions, not problems to be solved. (177)

* In the case that you have a CEO who doesn’t want to hear too much about problems, respect that you’re not going to get much coaching from him on the management side of things, and find another person to get that from. (177)

* Don’t shy away from delivering bad news. (177)

* Nothing shows respect like asking for someone’s advice. (177)

* You no longer have a manager; you have a boss. You probably still need to work on some skill development the first time you work in a senior leadership position, so get a coach, ask for training, and create a peer group outside of the company to support you through this brave new world. (178)

### Senior Peers in Other Functions
* Senior leaders, more than any other group in a company, must actively practice first-team focus (178)

* They are dedicated first and foremost to the business and its success, and secondly to the success of their departments as a way of contributing to the overall business success. (178)

* If you haven’t learned how to let a peer own her specialty, now is the time. Giving her respectful deference when it comes to her turf is fundamental. (178)

* Be willing to let those differences lie. (179)

* So, beyond establishing basic respect for your peers’ ownership of their turf and respect for their abilities as functional experts, you also have to put aside the idea that they’re acting in irrational or self-interested ways when they disagree with you or do things you don’t like. (179)

* A very common clash occurs between people who are extremely analytically driven and those who are more creatively or intuitively focused. (179)

* Another is between the people who prefer to embrace agility and change (and, yes, sometimes disorder) and those who push for more long-term planning, deadlines, and budgets. (179)

* Engineers frequently struggle with the transition to respecting and communicating well with diverse peers. I believe the struggle with respect is a side effect of the current tech culture, which tells us that engineers are the smartest people in the room. (179)

* Throwing out jargon to people who aren’t familiar with it—and who don’t even need to be familiar with it—makes us look stupid to them. We therefore need to figure out how to communicate the complexity of our work in a way that an intelligent but nontechnical peer can understand. (179)

* Cone of silence. (180)

* Once a decision is made, we commit to that decision and put on a united front in front of our engineering teams and anyone else in the company. (180)

### The Echo
* You’re no longer one of the team. Your first team is comprised of your peers at the leadership/ executive level, and your reporting structure has now become your second team. (180)

* Socializing heavily with your team outside of working hours is a thing of the past. (180)

* You need to detach for a few reasons. First, if you don’t detach, you’re likely to be accused of playing favorites. In fact, you probably will play favorites if you maintain very strong social ties with people who report up to you on the team. (180)

* Second, you need to detach because you need to learn how to lead effectively, and leading effectively requires people to take your words seriously. (180)

* As you choose which behaviors to model in front of the team, they will learn those behaviors and copy them. If you yell, they learn that yelling is OK. If you openly make mistakes and apologize, they learn that it’s OK to make mistakes. (181)

* You’re going to be part of hard decisions that will impact the whole business, and these decisions may cause you a great deal of stress. It won’t be appropriate to discuss these decisions with other people at the company. (181)

### Correcting a Culture of Fear
* If you want a team that feels comfortable taking risks and making mistakes, one of the core requirements is a sense of belonging and safety. This means you need to take a little time for small talk. (183)

* Apologies don’t need to be drawn-out affairs. A short apology that takes responsibility for your role in creating a negative situation or hurting another person is all that is necessary. If you go too long, it often turns into an excuse or a distraction. (184)

* When you disagree with something, stop to ask why. (184)

* When you take the time to seek out more information about something with which you disagree, you’ll often find that you were reacting to something you didn’t really understand. (184)

* Having a team that fears but respects you isn’t enough when they’re frustrated by other things happening around them. So work on softening your rough edges, practice caring about your team as humans, and get curious. (185)

### True North
* The True North for each functional area is slightly different, so there will be natural tension in the organization. (186)

* This tension is healthy because it forces us to reckon with all of the risks, not just the risks that our particular function cares about. (186)

### Assessing Your Own Experience
* Beyond a coach, how is your support network of peers outside of your company? Do you know other senior managers at companies in your area? A peer group helps you see what the job looks like at other companies, and is a place where you can share experiences and get advice. (188)

## 9. Bootstrapping Culture

* A common failing of first-time CTOs is to underestimate the importance of being clear and thoughtful about the culture of the engineering team. (191)

* If you want to create healthy teams, you need to have a sense of what is important to you, to your company, and to your growing group of colleagues. (191)

* You’re going to be trying out structures and processes and learning from them, but it’s hard to learn if you don’t have a basic theory to test, and you don’t set out to prove or disprove hypotheses about that theory. (192)

* Early startups attract people who are capable of dealing with extremely high amounts of uncertainty and risk in exchange for equally high degrees of freedom to operate. (192)

* pick a strategy and run with it. Cultivate decisiveness in the face of a massive number of options. You have a problem? Figure out a solution and fix it. That solution doesn’t work? Try something else. (192)

* One of the greatest writings about organizational politics is a piece called “The Tyranny of Structurelessness” by Jo Freeman. (193)

* Pretending to lack structure tends to create hidden power structures resulting from the nature of human communication and the challenges of trying to scale that communication. (193)

* Hiring “full stack” engineers who are exclusively sourced from the professional and social networks of the current team results in low skill specialization and high homogeneity. Forcing the team to be collocated lowers communication barriers. And perhaps most critically, having an engineering team that operates solely as the execution arm of the product or founder makes the team highly task-oriented. (194)

* Structure is how we scale, diversify, and take on more complex long-term tasks. (195)

* The same way that strong technical systems designers are capable of identifying and shaping underlying system structures, strong leaders are capable of identifying and shaping underlying team structures and dynamics, and doing so in a way that supports the long-term goals of the team and equips the individuals to achieve their best. (195)

* Structure can come too early, and cause harm by slowing down a group that should be focused on other things. (195)

* However, it’s more common in small companies to see structure come too late. (195)

### Assessing Your Role
* I don’t think there’s a huge benefit in overdesigning your team structure or process when your team is small and functioning well. However, at some point you’ll start to experience failure, and failure is the best place to investigate and identify where your structure needs to change. (197)

* My advice to leaders is simple: when failures occur, examine all aspects of reality that are contributing to those failures. (197)

* When every new hire slows the team down for months because there is no onboarding process, that is a failure due to lack of structure. (198)

* When people regularly leave the company because they have no path to advancement or career growth, that is a failure due to lack of structure. (198)

* The third time you have a production outage because someone logged directly into the database and accidentally dropped a critical table, that is a failure due to lack of structure. (198)

### Creating Your Culture
* Culture is the generally unspoken shared rules of a community. (199)

* But in complex environments where the needs of the group must override the needs of the individual, cultural values are the glue that enables us to work as a team and make decisions when faced with uncertainty. (199)

* Not every person will fit in at every company. The sooner you realize this, the better. (199)

* I would argue that a thoughtfully created set of values that are actually values should reduce the kinds of surface discrimination that often happen at tech companies in favor of creating a real community of employees who share core principles and ways of communication. (199)

* You’ll be measured against these values whether you realize it or not. The founding team’s values will be reinforced, recognized, and rewarded inside of the company. (200)

* Employees who truly embrace and exhibit all of the core values of a company tend to do well naturally. (200)

### Applying Core Values
* Understanding and cultivating culture is a key part of your job as a leader. (200)

* First, define your culture. If you have a set of company values, map those values onto your team. (200)

* We layered a learning culture on top of our company values, because we believed that this was important for us as engineers. (201)

* Second, reinforce your culture by rewarding people for exhibiting its values in positive ways. (201)

* People can share core value stories at company all-hands meetings. (201)

* One of the most important uses of performance reviews is to evaluate the alignment between team members’ values and the company’s values, and therefore what values should be part of your performance review process. (201)

* “Happiness and positivity is a choice” is actually one of the core values of Rent the Runway (201)

* Finally, use this as part of your interview process. Remind your interviewers of the values of the team, and ask them to look out explicitly for places where the interviewee seems to match or collide with these values. (202)

* Cultural fit is not about hiring friends. I’ve had great working relationships with people that I would not want to chat with for hours outside of work, and terrible working relationships with people I would love to be stuck with in an airport. (202)

* Culture fit as determined by friendship tests is almost certain to be discriminatory in some way. (202)

* A very smart engineer who really values independence may not be a fit for a team where everyone must collaborate extensively on all projects. (202)

* Someone who believes that the most analytical argument always wins may not work well in a company that values empathy and intuition over pure analytical skill. (202)

### Creating Cultural Policy
* There comes a time for adding structure, and that time is usually when things are failing. (202)

* What works for one company—a company that is creating a certain type of product or working in a certain industry—will not always translate well to another company, even if the companies have a lot of things in common. (204)

### Writing a Career Ladder
* Some people advise having a lot of levels toward the beginning of the ladder to account for the fact that early-career engineers expect frequent raises and promotions. You may want to be able to promote someone every year for the first two to three years of her career. (205)

* Create several levels that encompass the role of software engineer and provide relatively narrow salary bands for those levels, on the expectation that people in those roles are either being promoted quickly or moving on from your company. (206)

* Use narrow salary bands for early-career stages. (206)

* Use wide salary bands when and where you have fewer levels. (206)

* In the case of widely spaced levels, you want to have large salary bands and you want those salary bands to overlap. (206)

* That means a strong software engineer may make more than a senior engineer. You need this wiggle room to retain talent who are performing well at their current levels but are not ready to take on the additional responsibility of the next level. (206)

* What is the lowest level at which people can sit forever, never getting promoted but also not underperforming? This is your breakpoint level. (206)

* Expect your team to cluster around this level, with fewer people above or below it. (207)

* However, I do encourage you to have at least some of your levels be keystone promotions, which are shared and celebrated. I think that the promotion to senior engineer is a big deal, as well as the promotion to staff engineer and, if you have such a role, principal engineer. On the management track, a promotion to director is worth celebrating, as is a promotion to VP. (207)

* However, you should not necessarily expect to have the same number of people in the senior technical levels as you do in the senior management levels. Senior management is generally a volume-driven need. You need enough managers to manage the people you have on the team. Senior technical depends on the complexity and scope of technical leadership that your teams and products require. (207)

* Consider making leadership experience (usually via acting as a tech lead) a requirement for promotion to senior individual contributor levels. (208)

### Cross-Functional Teams
* When we put cross-functional teams together, we are acknowledging that the most important communication—the communication that we need to favor above all else—is that which leads to effective product development and iteration. Note that this structure will not necessarily produce the most effective technology! In fact, it will probably produce systems that have some inefficiencies compared to companies that have a more engineering-centered team structure. (210)

### Structuring Cross-Functional Teams
* In technology-focused structures where engineers work solely with other engineers, particularly engineers of their same “type” (mobile, backend, middleware, etc.), the focus is on being the best engineer by some measure of engineering excellence. (211)

* In a product-focused structure, the leadership focus changes. Now the engineers who have the best product sense, the engineers who are capable of getting features done quickly and efficiently, and the engineers who communicate the best with the other functions will start to emerge as the leaders of the team. (211)

* What is truly important to the success of your company or your organization? If the most important thing is evolving a product that is a function of many different business areas coming together, you probably want leaders who have that business sense. On the other hand, in the areas where the technology must be rock-solid or exceptionally innovative and cutting-edge, you probably want teams that have more of an engineering focus and that are led by people who can design complex systems. You don’t have to go entirely one way or the other, (211)

### Developing Engineering Processes
* General angst and frustration that you can cause by adopting the wrong engineering processes for your teams. Without any process, your teams will struggle to scale. With the wrong process, they will be slowed down. (212)

* There’s a saying in politics that “a good political idea is one that works well in half-baked form,” and the same goes for engineering processes. The processes should have value even when they are not followed perfectly, (213)

### Code Review
* Code review is often a place where engineers behave poorly toward one another, using it as a platform to criticize their colleagues or to enforce unrealistic standards. (213)

* Engineers can waste absurd amounts of time on questions of style, specifically formatting. This should not be up for debate in code review. Decide on a style, and put that style into a linter that formats the code automatically. (214)

### The Outage Postmortem
* Instead of calling the process a postmortem, many have started calling it a “learning review” to indicate that its purpose is not determining cause of death but learning from the incident. (214)

* Unfortunately, this blaming only results in people being afraid to make mistakes. (214)

* You want to understand and identify the factors that contributed to this incident. This might include looking for tests that would have detected the problem, or tools that could have made the incident management go more smoothly. (214)

* Many learning reviews end in a laundry list of things that could be improved (215)

* Pick the one or two that are truly high-risk and highly likely to cause future problems, and acknowledge the ones that you are going to let go for now. (215)

### Architecture Review
* The goal of architecture review is to help socialize big changes to the appropriate group, and to make the risks for those changes clear. (215)

* Be specific about the kinds of changes that need architecture review. (215)

* Choose the review board wisely. You want the review board to include the people who will be most affected by the change, not just a static chosen group of gurus. Part of the goal is to get yourself out of the hot seat for making every technical decision, and part of the goal is to make sure that those who will need to deal with the outcome of the decision are part of evaluating it. (216)

* There’s nothing more demoralizing than having someone from a completely unrelated area veto a project. (216)

## 10. Conclusion

* Great managers are masters of working through conflict. Getting good at working through conflict means getting good at taking your ego out of the conversation (217).

* Learning to recognize the voice of your ego is one of the benefits of meditation (217)

* For me, having a meditation practice has been essential to developing self-management and self-awareness. (217)

* Meditation resources: podcasts on tarabrach.com, Pema Chödrön (217)

* One other trick I use to get away from my ego is curiosity. (217)

* Becoming a great leader was a series of difficult lessons, mistakes, and challenges. (218)
