# Lesson 1: Machine Learning Bird's Eye View

## 1.1: Introduction

## 1.2: History - A Statistician's Perspective

* Probabilities models typically do a limited job simulating real-world data; they are simplifications

## 1.3: History - A Computer Scientist's Perspective

* Motivation: not hardcoding rules as nested if-else statements
* **Machine learning**: looking for patterns in data
* Developing increasingly flexible models doing better job than previous modeling techniques at capturing real-world patterns in data
* Current models are complex, but can outperform models using if-else statements as well as statistical models
* Unfortunately, these models often leave the "why?" of a prediction unknown

## 1.4: Types of Machine Learning - Supervised

* Three main categories of machine learning:
    - Supervised
    - Unsupervised
    - Reinforcement Learning
* **Supervised learning**: algorithms learn from labeled data, and associate labels with unlabeled data
* Two categories of supervised learning:
    - **Classification**: categorical outcomes (e.g., is spam; breed of dog)
    - **Regression**: numeric value (e.g., home price; person's height)

## 1.5: Types of Machine Learning - Unsupervised Learning

* **Unsupervised Learning**: creates models for data when there are no pre-existing labels to train on. Examples:
    - Reducing set of features to lower dimensionality
    - Grouping similar items
    - Music recommendation system
* **Reinforcement Learning**: take actions and receive rewards. Examples:
    - Self-driving cars
    - Game playing agents (e.g., AlphaGo; gaming agents in Open AI Gym)

## 1.6: Deep Learning

* Typically beats other techniques
* Can be used for supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learnign
* Care more about accuracy of predictions than how/why our model makes predictions
* Barriers to entry:
    - Requires a lot of data
    - Requires a lot of computing power
    - Won't understand why certain decisions are made

## 1.7: Machine Learning Libraries

* TensorFlow and Scikit-learn are two of the most popular open-source libraries for solving machine learning problems

## 1.8: Ethics in Machine Learning

* Given data often holds errors and biases, models will do the same
* E.g., biases in historic data on hiring decisions (based on gender, age, race, economic status, etc), these biases will be held by any predictive models
* Humans transmit our biases to models via the data

## 1.9: What's Ahead

* Thus far, supervised machine learning has gain most traction with business applications

## 1.10: Recap
