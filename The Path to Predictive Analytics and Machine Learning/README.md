# The Path to Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning

## 1: Building Real-Time Data Pipelines

* Domain-specific languages like R generally not suitable for low-latency production envs (1)
* Starts w/ high-through messaging system (e.g., Kafka), then the transformation tier (incl enrichment, filtering, aggregation; e.g., Spark streaming), the persistent datastore (2-4)
* Traditionally, OLTP (real-time data) and OLAP (historical data) are siloed, and moving data between them requires ETL. This siloing prevents real-time application. (5-6)
