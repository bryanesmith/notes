HBR's 10 Must Reads

## Competing in the Age of AI

* AI removes workers from “critical path” at core of business to the edges (1)

* "AI factory": aka decision factory, AI making critical business decisions 

* four components for an "AI factory": 1) data pipeline, (2) algorithms, (3) experimentation platform, (4) infrastructure 

* in terms of scale, AI pushes back the point of diminishing returns


## How to Win with Machine Learning

- goal: use ML to create a defensible moat around business/how to build a sustainable competitive advantage against latecomers (16)

- challenges with data; users not incentivized to share; environment is non-stationary and new data is needed

- building competitive advantage with ML: 1) lot of quality training data, 2) fast feedback loops, 3) inferior predictions

- early mover can build scale-based competitive advantage 

- how can latecomers catch up?: 1) identify alternative data sources, 2) differentiate the prediction (e.g., target a subpopulation where predictions may vary)

## Developing a Digital Mindset

- transformation requires a bold stroke (e.g., phasing out legacy system or process; reorg; acquisition) followed by a long march

- employees more likely to build a competency when they buy into transformation strategy and feel capable of making it a reality

- three components of Moderna’s success with technology: 1)?enormous access to data, 2) reliance on cloud computing (more agile), 3) using AI to improve accuracy and speed for R&D

- don’t separate operations and technology; successful digitization best fits into processes that integrate instead of silo

- change mindset is cultural; even IT companies require cultural change to drive successful digital transformation 

## Learning to Work with Intelligent Machines

* Automation is undermining traditional ways of learning on the job, and people are breaking rules (and risking their jobs) to find innovative ways to learn (**shadow learning**)

* Obstacles to learning:
    1. trainees are being moved away from the "learning edge"
    2. experts are being distanced from the work
    3. learners are expected to master both old and new methods
    4. and yet, standing learning methods are presumed to be effective

* Solutions:
    - seeking struggle
    - tapping frontline know-how
    - redesigning roles (make sure your metrics aren't undermining adoption of new tools)
    - curating solutions

## Getting AI to Scale

* Companies are applying AI for discrete use cases, failing to achieve the scale needed to achieve transformational ability

* Steps:
    1. Set the Strategy: pick a department where can make big transformations with interconnected activities with a sponsor and reusable technology and data
    2. Structure the Team
    3. Reimagine Business as Usual: work backwards from a vision (using design thinking), and identifying the issues with the current processes
    4. Adapt for Organizational and Technological Change, including targeted technological investments (e.g., cloud adoption)
    
* After a strong organizational foothold, there's a domino effect; pursue multiple domains in parallel, building off past work

## Why You Aren't Getting More from Your Marketing AI

* Fewer than 40% of companies investing in AI see gains from it

* AI failure modes:
    1. Not asking the right questions
    2. Not recognizing the difference between the value of being right and the costs of being wrong and assuming all prediction mistakes are equivalent
    3. Not leveraging AI's ability to make more frequent, granular decisions and instead continuing tto follow their old practices

* Framework in practice:
    1. What is the marketing problem we are trying to solve?
    2. Is there any waste or missed opportunity in our current approach?
    3. What is causing the waste and missed opportunities?

## The Pitfalls of Pricing Algorithms

* Pricing algorithms adjust prices in realtime to maximize profits, but constant prices changes can alienate customers, undermine their loyalty

* Companies fail to assess the impact of frequent prices on customers psychologically, leading customers to question the motives of the companies

* Companies should develop a proper use case and narrative around pricing algorithm, create an owner to manage it (diffuse ownership is a problem), and create guardrails, monitors, and manual controls to override the pricing algorithm

## A Smarter Strategy for Using Robots

* **"Lights Out" automation**: when automate to extent that don't need humans, and companies don't even need to turn on the lights

* Two challenges of achieving "lights out" automation:
    1. Adoption of automation technology is limited
    2. Gaining productivity from automation comes at cost of flexibility (**zero-sum automation**)

* **Positive-sum automation**: when gain productivity and flexibility as result of automation

* To achieve positive-sum automation:
    1. Companies should design technology to make it easier for employees to train and debug robots
    2. Use a bottom-up approach to identify what tasks should be automated (solicit feedback from line employees)
    3. Choose the right metrics for measuring success
