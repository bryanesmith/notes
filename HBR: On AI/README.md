## How to Win with Machine Learning

- goal: use ML to create a defensible moat around business/how to build a sustainable competitive advantage against latecomers (16)

- challenges with data; users not incentivized to share; environment is non-stationary and new data is needed

- building competitive advantage with ML: 1) lot of quality training data, 2) fast feedback loops, 3) inferior predictions

- early mover can build scale-based competitive advantage 

- how can latecomers catch up?: 1) identify alternative data sources, 2) differentiate the prediction (e.g., target a subpopulation where predictions may vary)

## Developing a Digital Mindset

- transformation requires a bold stroke (e.g., phasing out legacy system or process; reorg; acquisition) followed by a long march

- employees more likely to build a competency when they buy into transformation strategy and feel capable of making it a reality

- three components of Moderna’s success with technology: 1)?enormous access to data, 2) reliance on cloud computing (more agile), 3) using AI to improve accuracy and speed for R&D

- don’t separate operations and technology; successful digitization best fits into processes that integrate instead of silo

- change mindset is cultural; even IT companies require cultural change to drive successful digital transformation 

## Learning to Work with Intelligent Machines

* Automation is undermining traditional ways of learning on the job, and people are breaking rules (and risking their jobs) to find innovative ways to learn ("shadow learning")

* Obstacles to learning:
    1. trainees are being moved away from the "learning edge"
    2. experts are being distanced from the work
    3. learners are expected to master both old and new methods
    4. and yet, standing learning methods are presumed to be effective

* Solutions:
    - seeking struggle
    - tapping frontline know-how
    - redesigning roles (make sure your metrics aren't undermining adoption of new tools)
    - curating solutions
