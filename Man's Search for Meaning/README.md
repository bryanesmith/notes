# Man's Search for Meaning

Viktor E. Frankl, Nov 4 2018

## Foreword
* Nietzsche: "He who has a Why to live forcan bear almost any How." (21)
* Life is not a quest for pleasure (Freud) or a quest for power (Alfred Adler), but a quest for meaning. (27)
* Three sources of meaning: in work, in love, and in courage during difficult times. (28)
* Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it. (30)

## I: Experiences in a Concentration Camp
* "Delusion of reprieve": condemned man, right before execution, believes will be reprieved at last moment. (10)
* An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior. (20)
* Prisoner passes to second phase, which is relative apathy, a kind of emotional death. (20)
* Apathy is necessary mechanism of self-defense. All emotions focused on one task: survival. (28)
* The incorrigible optimists are the most irritating companions. (34)
* Sensitive people with rich intellectual life may suffer less damage to their inner selves; apparent paradox that some prisoners of less hardy make-up often seemed to survive camp life better. (36)
* Love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. (37)
* The salvation of man is through love and in love. (37)
* Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved. It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, hist inner self. Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not his still alive at all, ceases somehow to be of importance. (38)
* Camp inmates frightened of making decisions or taking initiative; fate is master, one must not try to influence it in any way. (56)
* The experiences of camp life show that man does have a choice of action. (65)
* The sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone. (66)
* Dostoevski: "There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings."
* My comrades agreed when I said that in camp a day lasted longer than a week. (71)
* Man in decline thinks of the past, but this presents a certain danger: it is easy to overlook opportunities to make something positive of camp life. (71)
* Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it. (74)
* The prisoner who had lost faith in the future was doomed. (74)
* The sudden loss of hope and courage can have a deadly effect. (75)
* It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life-daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. (77)
* Questions about the meaning of life can never be answered by sweeping statements. "Life" does not mean something vague, but something very real and concrete, just as life's tasks are also very real and concrete. They form man's destiny, which is different and unique for each individual. (77)
* When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden. (77)
* Both men had talked of their intentions to commit suicide. Both used the typical argument-they had nothing more to expect from life. In both cases it was a question of getting them to realize that life was still expecting something from them... (79)
* When the impossibility of replacing a person is realized, it allows the responsibility which a man has for his existence and its continuance to appear in all its magnitude. (79)
* It is apparent that the mere knowledge that a man was either a camp guard or a prisoner tells us almost nothing. Human kindness can be found in all groups, even those which as a whole it would be easy to condemn. (86)
* What happens to liberated prisoners called "depersonalization": everything appears unreal, like a dream. (88)
* Such enormous mental pressure for such a long time is naturally in some danger after his liberation... (90)
* Now, being free, they thought they could use their freedom licentiously and ruthlessly. The only thing that had changed for them was that they were now the oppressors instead of the oppressed... They justified their behavior by their own terrible experiences. (90)
* Only slowly could these men be guided back to the commonplace truth that no one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them. (91)
* Apart from the moral deformity resulting from the sudden release of mental pressure, there were two other fundamental experiences which threatened to damage the character of the liberated prisoner: bitterness and disillusionment when he returned to his former life. (91)
