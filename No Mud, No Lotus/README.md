# No Mud, No Lotus

By Thich Nhat Hahn

## Part 1: Contents

### 1. The Art of Transforming Suffering

* Knowing how to suffer well is essential to realizing true happiness. (10)

#### Suffering and happiness are not separate

* 'Suffering' and 'happiness' are not separate things, just like 'left' and 'right' are not separate (11)
* Suffering is not an illusion, and we don't want to transcend it; we want to stay in touch with it (12)

#### No mud, no lotus

* Suffering becomes happiness, which becomes suffering, etc; like how a flower wilts and becomes compost, which grows another flower (12)

#### Did the Buddha suffer?

* The Buddha did suffer physically and emotionally, even after enlightenment; but he knew how to suffer and so he suffered much less. (14)

#### The Four Noble Truths

* If we recognize suffering, and if we embrace it and look deeply into its roots, then we'll be able to let go of the habits that feed it, and find a way to happiness. Suffering is an excellent teacher. (15)

#### What suffering is made of

* When hurt, animals instinctively rest; humans have lost this kind of wisdom, and do not know how to rest anymore. (16)

#### Healing medicine

* Covering up suffering with consumption is the main affliction of modern civilization. (16) 
* Mindfulness helps us make good use of suffering to generate understanding and compassion that heals us and allows us help others. (18)

#### Generating mindfulness

### 2. Saying Hello

* We consume (e.g., junk food, computer games) to cover up our suffering, creating addictions without addressing the root issue. (22)
* Consuming to cover suffering doesn't work; need to look deeply into suffering to get insight into it and make a breakthrough. (23)

#### Stopping and acknowledging suffering

* When suffering arises, the first thing to do is stop, follow our breathing, and acknowledge it: (23)
    ```
    Breathing in, I know suffering is there.
    Breathing out, I say hello to my suffering.
    ```
* A few breaths taken with full attention can pause regret and sorrow about the past as well as uncertainty and fear about the future. (23)

#### Body and mind together

* Very often, our minds are in the past, future, or projects; mindful breathing reunites the mind and body. (24)
* When the mind reunites with the body, the mental discourse stops its chattering. (24)

#### The pull of distractions

#### Embracing suffering

* Suffering can overwhelm our mind; so we invite the energy of mindfulness at the same time. (26)
* Don't fight or suppress suffering; cradle it. Mindfulness is like a mother, suffering is like a crying baby; the mother recognizes and embraces the baby without judgment. (27)
* Depression is one of the most widespread forms of depression. (27)

#### The bell

* A bell of mindfulness is a reminder to come back to ourselves, to come back to life here in the present moment. (28)

### 3. Looking Deeply

#### Understanding the pain

* Once mindful energy soothed our suffering, we can begin to look more deeply into its nature and sources. (32)

* A human being without understanding is a human being without compassion, utterly alone, cut off, and isolated. (32)

#### The pain of our ancestors

* Our suffering is not just our's; it belongs to our ancestors as well. (33-4)

* You may be angry at your parents, and want to cut them off; but your parents are in your cells, and by being angry with them you are angry at yourself. You cannot cut them off; it is better to look deeply and transform and heal the suffering and stop the intergenerational cycle of suffering. (34)

#### Exploring our fear

* So many of us walk around with the pain and agitation of useless fear, including the fear of dying, hunger, loss, etc. (34-5)

* If you are afraid of dying, know that you are dying right now; dying and living inter-are. Everything dies and renews itself all the time. (35)

#### Your true aspiration

* When we are full of fear, we are often completely focused on preventing the event we dread, and we forget that joy is also possible even in an unpredictable world. (36)

* People are victims of their success, becoming trapped in their next set of goals; but no one is ever a victim of happiness. (36)

* Most of us postpone happiness, and struggle now so that we will be happy in the future, as if we don't yet meet the conditions to be happy. (36)

* The habit of running into the future creates tension, both in the body and the mind; it's a major source of our suffering. (37)

* Instead of barreling ahead in our ambitions, we need to take the time to stop, come home to ourselve, look deeply, and discover what brings our deepest happiness. (37)

#### Developing understanding and compassion ðŸŒŸ

* The roots of our suffering are deep and connected with the roots of the suffering of others. Understanding our own hurt allows us to see and understand the suffering of others. (38)

* When you are angry with others, you may not believe they have any reason to be unhappy; but if you look deeply, you will see the suffering in them. What they need is help, not punishment. In this way, you can transform the suffering of anger into the flower of compassion. (38)

* Our suffering overflows out onto the people around us - especially to the closest people we love the most. (39)

* A world without suffering would be a world without compassion and understanding. (37)

#### Easing communication

* It's no wonder we have difficulty understanding others, as we have a hard time understanding the conflicts and tensions in ourselves, and others have the same difficulties with themselves. (40)

* We need help, others need help. We are all suffering. No one needs punishment, and punshing another won't improve anyone's situation. (40)

* Compassionate istening is a good way to give the other person the chance to speak and suffer less. What they say may be full of bitterness and wrong perception, but do not interrupt or correct; hold onto your true purpose, to listen and allow them to speak. (40-1)

#### Being a mindfulness bell for a loved one

### 4. Ease

* If we know how to handle the little sufferings (e.g., worrying about how others think about us, missing a promotion, making a faux pas), we can save our energy to embrace and soothe the true pains of illness and loss that are unavoidable. (46)

#### Releasing the arrow

* Being anxious, judgmental, fearful, or angry about an unwelcome event (e.g., losing a valuable object) is like being hit by a second arrow, magnifying our suffering. (46)

* Part of the art of suffering well is learning not to magnify our pain by getting carried away in fear, anger, and despair. (47)

* Remember that everthing is impermanent, including suffering. (47)

#### Complexes and the sense of a separate self

* A basic problem that causes us to suffer is the idea that we are a separate self, leading us to compare ourselves to others. (48)

#### Greener grass: the story of the Buddha and Mara

* In Buddhist stories, **Mara** is the personlification of all depravity and delusion, and everything that makes us suffer in life.

### 5. Five Practices for Nurturing Happiness

* We don't have to wait for the end of all suffering to be happy; happiness is availble to use right now. (56)

* Our definition of "happiness" may be preventing us from experiencing happiness. (56)

#### The difference between joy and happiness

* "Joy" and "happiness" are different; joy contains an element of excitment. If you are dying of thirst in the dessert and see an oasis with fresh water, joy is this discovery; happiness is the first drink of water. (56)

#### Why the Buddha kept meditating

* Everything is impermanent, including happiness. To continue to be happy, you must feed it; which is why we continue to meditate. (57)

#### The first practice: letting go

* Many of the things we think we need to be happy are really obstacles for our joy and happiness. (57)

* When you have the courage to let go of things preventing your happiness (e.g., a relationship, a career), happiness comes very quickly without searching for it. (58)

#### Releasing your cows

* The story of the miserable farmer who lost his cows and crops, and the happy monks who had nothing to lose. (58-60)

* Exercise: take a piece of paper and write down the names of your cows, the things you think of as crucial for your well-being. This week, try releasing one or two. See if you can release any over the next year. (60)

#### The story of Badhiya

#### The second practice: inviting positive seeds

* The seeds of our unconscious that we water sprout, come up into our awareness, and manifest outwardly. (62)

* Instead of fighting your arogance, nurture its opposite seed, compassion; as the seed of compassion becomes strong through mindfulness, arrogance will go down without fighting it or pushing it. (62)

* Water the good seeds and refrain from watering the negative seeds. (62)

#### The third practice: mindfulness-based joy

* You can generate mindful energy all day - while washing dishes, cooking dinner, mopping the floor. (63)

* With mindfulness, you can touch the many conditions of happiness and joy that are already available. (63)

#### Enjoying sitting

* Sitting can be very healing, very profitable in its own way. (64)

#### Enjoying our steps

* There are so many wonders of life around us and inside us that we're unable to be in touch with because we're always in a hurry. (64)

* There's no point in doing sitting or walking meditation unless you enjoy it; it would be a waste of time. (63, 64)

* Many of us have found success - we have enough money, we have a spouse and family - yet we're not happy. Perhaps its because we aren't practicing mindfulness that helps us recognize the many conditions of happiness that are already there. (65)

#### Morning verse for happiness

* Waking up and breath, and become aware that you have twenty-four brand-new hours to live. This is the gift of life. (66)

#### Creating happiness

* If you write down all the conditions for happiness available to you now (e.g., the ability to walk, to see the sky, to smell a flower, enjoy a breath), four pages may not be enough. When we can recognize all these elements, it's so easy to generate happiness. (68)

#### The fourth practice: concentration

* Concentration has the power to break through and burn away the afflictions that make you suffer. (68)

* When we have concentration, we have a lot of energy. We won't get carried away by visions of past suffering or fears about the future. (68)

#### The fifth practice: insight

* Insight brings us clarity that can liberate us from afflictions such as jealousy and anger, and allow true happiness to come. (69)

* Consciously call up our challenges of the past (e.g., allergies in spring) to help ourselves treasure the good things we are having right now (e.g., clear air in the winter). (70)

* Don't get caught up in previous suffering, but say to ourselves, "How lucky I am right now. I am not in that situation." That is insight. (70)

### 6. Happiness Is Not an Individual Matter

* Your body, your life is not just your's; it is a continuation of your ancestors, your nation, your culture. 

#### Borrowing mindfulness

#### Being there for another's sorrows

* The most precious thing you can offer a loved one is your presence. It's not something you can buy in the supermarket. (75-6)

#### Collective suffering, collective joy

* Action pushed by the collective energy of anger and fear is not usually right action. (76)

#### Taking refuge in oneself

* We consume our environment as a kind of food, and its good or harmful elements seep into us. (77)

#### Collective action

* In the collective we can see the individual, and in the individual there is the collective. There is no absolute individuality; there is no absolute collectivity. (78)

* Anything you can do to lessen suffering in your community and in the world is known in Buddhism as **Right Action**. (78)

#### The whole world is our territory

* If there is Mara, there is Buddha. (79)

#### The art of happiness

* The essence of our practice can be described as transforming suffering into happiness. (81)
