# No Mud, No Lotus

By Thich Nhat Hahn

## 1. The Art of Transforming Suffering

* Knowing how to suffer well is essential to realizing true happiness. (10)

### Suffering and happiness are not separate

* 'Suffering' and 'happiness' are not separate things, just like 'left' and 'right' are not separate (11)
* Suffering is not an illusion, and we don't want to transcend it; we want to stay in touch with it (12)

### No mud, no lotus

* Suffering becomes happiness, which becomes suffering, etc; like how a flower wilts and becomes compost, which grows another flower (12)

### Did the Buddha suffer?

* The Buddha did suffer physically and emotionally, even after enlightenment; but he knew how to suffer and so he suffered much less. (14)

### The Four Noble Truths

* If we recognize suffering, and if we embrace it and look deeply into its roots, then we'll be able to let go of the habits that feed it, and find a way to happiness. Suffering is an excellent teacher. (15)

### What suffering is made of

* When hurt, animals instinctively rest; humans have lost this kind of wisdom, and do not know how to rest anymore. (16)

### Healing medicine

* Covering up suffering with consumption is the main affliction of modern civilization. (16) 
* Mindfulness helps us make good use of suffering to generate understanding and compassion that heals us and allows us help others. (18)

### Generating mindfulness

## 2. Saying Hello

* We consume (e.g., junk food, computer games) to cover up our suffering, creating addictions without addressing the root issue. (22)
* Consuming to cover suffering doesn't work; need to look deeply into suffering to get insight into it and make a breakthrough. (23)

### Stopping and acknowledging suffering

* When suffering arises, the first thing to do is stop, follow our breathing, and acknowledge it: (23)
    ```
    Breathing in, I know suffering is there.
    Breathing out, I say hello to my suffering.
    ```
* A few breaths taken with full attention can pause regret and sorrow about the past as well as uncertainty and fear about the future. (23)

### Body and mind together

* Very often, our minds are in the past, future, or projects; mindful breathing reunites the mind and body. (24)
* When the mind reunites with the body, the mental discourse stops its chattering. (24)

### The pull of distractions

### Embracing suffering

* Suffering can overwhelm our mind; so we invite the energy of mindfulness at the same time. (26)
* Don't fight or suppress suffering; cradle it. Mindfulness is like a mother, suffering is like a crying baby; the mother recognizes and embraces the baby without judgment. (27)
* Depression is one of the most widespread forms of depression. (27)

### The bell

* A bell of mindfulness is a reminder to come back to ourselves, to come back to life here in the present moment. (28)

## 3. Looking Deeply

### Understanding the pain

* Once mindful energy soothed our suffering, we can begin to look more deeply into its nature and sources. (32)

* A human being without understanding is a human being without compassion, utterly alone, cut off, and isolated. (32)

### The pain of our ancestors

* Our suffering is not just our's; it belongs to our ancestors as well. (33-4)

* You may be angry at your parents, and want to cut them off; but your parents are in your cells, and by being angry with them you are angry at yourself. You cannot cut them off; it is better to look deeply and transform and heal the suffering and stop the intergenerational cycle of suffering. (34)

### Exploring our fear

* So many of us walk around with the pain and agitation of useless fear, including the fear of dying, hunger, loss, etc. (34-5)

* If you are afraid of dying, know that you are dying right now; dying and living inter-are. Everything dies and renews itself all the time. (35)

### Your true aspiration

* When we are full of fear, we are often completely focused on preventing the event we dread, and we forget that joy is also possible even in an unpredictable world. (36)

* People are victims of their success, becoming trapped in their next set of goals; but no one is ever a victim of happiness. (36)

* Most of us postpone happiness, and struggle now so that we will be happy in the future, as if we don't yet meet the conditions to be happy. (36)

* The habit of running into the future creates tension, both in the body and the mind; it's a major source of our suffering. (37)

* Instead of barreling ahead in our ambitions, we need to take the time to stop, come home to ourselve, look deeply, and discover what brings our deepest happiness. (37)

### Developing understanding and compassion ðŸŒŸ

* The roots of our suffering are deep and connected with the roots of the suffering of others. Understanding our own hurt allows us to see and understand the suffering of others. (38)

* When you are angry with others, you may not believe they have any reason to be unhappy; but if you look deeply, you will see the suffering in them. What they need is help, not punishment. In this way, you can transform the suffering of anger into the flower of compassion. (38)

* Our suffering overflows out onto the people around us - especially to the closest people we love the most. (39)

* A world without suffering would be a world without compassion and understanding. (37)

### Easing communication

* It's no wonder we have difficulty understanding others, as we have a hard time understanding the conflicts and tensions in ourselves, and others have the same difficulties with themselves. (40)

* We need help, others need help. We are all suffering. No one needs punishment, and punshing another won't improve anyone's situation. (40)

* Compassionate istening is a good way to give the other person the chance to speak and suffer less. What they say may be full of bitterness and wrong perception, but do not interrupt or correct; hold onto your true purpose, to listen and allow them to speak. (40-1)
