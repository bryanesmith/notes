# No Mud, No Lotus

By Thich Nhat Hahn

## 1. The Art of Transforming Suffering

* Knowing how to suffer well is essential to realizing true happiness. (10)

### Suffering and happiness are not separate

* 'Suffering' and 'happiness' are not separate things, just like 'left' and 'right' are not separate (11)
* Suffering is not an illusion, and we don't want to transcend it; we want to stay in touch with it (12)

### No mud, no lotus

* Suffering becomes happiness, which becomes suffering, etc; like how a flower wilts and becomes compost, which grows another flower (12)

### Did the Buddha suffer?

* The Buddha did suffer physically and emotionally, even after enlightenment; but he knew how to suffer and so he suffered much less. (14)

### The Four Noble Truths

* If we recognize suffering, and if we embrace it and look deeply into its roots, then we'll be able to let go of the habits that feed it, and find a way to happiness. Suffering is an excellent teacher. (15)

### What suffering is made of

* When hurt, animals instinctively rest; humans have lost this kind of wisdom, and do not know how to rest anymore. (16)

### Healing medicine

* Covering up suffering with consumption is the main affliction of modern civilization. (16) 
* Mindfulness helps us make good use of suffering to generate understanding and compassion that heals us and allows us help others. (18)

## 2. Saying Hello

* We consume (e.g., junk food, computer games) to cover up our suffering, creating addictions without addressing the root issue. (22)
* Consuming to cover suffering doesn't work; need to look deeply into suffering to get insight into it and make a breakthrough. (23)

### Stopping and acknowledging suffering

* When suffering arises, the first thing to do is stop, follow our breathing, and acknowledge it: (23)
    ```
    Breathing in, I know suffering is there.
    Breathing out, I say hello to my suffering.
    ```
* A few breaths taken with full attention can pause regret and sorrow about the past as well as uncertainty and fear about the future. (23)

### Body and mind together

* Very often, our minds are in the past, future, or projects; mindful breathing reunites the mind and body. (24)
* When the mind reunites with the body, the mental discourse stops its chattering. (24)

### The pull of distractions

### Embracing suffering

* Suffering can overwhelm our mind; so we invite the energy of mindfulness at the same time. (26)
* Don't fight or suppress suffering; cradle it. Mindfulness is like a mother, suffering is like a crying baby; the mother recognizes and embraces the baby without judgment. (27)
* Depression is one of the most widespread forms of depression. (27)

### The bell

* A bell of mindfulness is a reminder to come back to ourselves, to come back to life here in the present moment. (28)
