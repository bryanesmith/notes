# No Mud, No Lotus

By Thich Nhat Hahn

## 1. The Art of Transforming Suffering

* Knowing how to suffer well is essential to realizing true happiness. (10)

### Suffering and happiness are not separate

* 'Suffering' and 'happiness' are not separate things, just like 'left' and 'right' are not separate (11)
* Suffering is not an illusion, and we don't want to transcend it; we want to stay in touch with it (12)

### No mud, no lotus

* Suffering becomes happiness, which becomes suffering, etc; like how a flower wilts and becomes compost, which grows another flower (12)

### Did the Buddha suffer?

* The Buddha did suffer physically and emotionally, even after enlightenment; but he knew how to suffer and so he suffered much less. (14)

### The Four Noble Truths

* If we recognize suffering, and if we embrace it and look deeply into its roots, then we'll be able to let go of the habits that feed it, and find a way to happiness. Suffering is an excellent teacher. (15)

### What suffering is made of

* When hurt, animals instinctively rest; humans have lost this kind of wisdom, and do not know how to rest anymore. (16)

### Healing medicine

* Covering up suffering with consumption is the main affliction of modern civilization. (16) 
* Mindfulness helps us make good use of suffering to generate understanding and compassion that heals us and allows us help others. (18)
