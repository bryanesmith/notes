"Roger Bannister","Broke four-minute mile in 1954"
"glycogen","stored carbohydrates. Body runs low around 90 minutes of running."
"periodization","seasonal approach to running w/ distinct phases; e.g., base training, strength-building, competition, recovery. works well for elite runners."
"lactate threshold","intensity level at which anaerobic energy production begins to negatively impact performance"
"anaerobic energy","energy created within cells without oxygen, created when body needs energy faster than body can produce with oxygen"
"VO2 max","maximum amount of oxygen your body can consume within a minute"
"running economy","how efficiently you use oxygen at give pace"
"lactate","byproduct of anaerobic energy production"
"stroke volume","how much blood your heart can pump with each beat"
"even splits","maintaining same pace for each running split"
"negative splits","picking up pace during later splits in run"
"tempo run","sustained run (10-40 min+) at 'comfortably hard' pace you could maintain at least an hour"
"fartlek","Swedish for 'speed play'. unstructured blend of different paces aimed at challenging both aerobic and anaerobic fitness."
"age grading","in race, each runner's finish time is scored as a percentage of maximum performance expected based on runner's age"
"mitochondria","cellular structures responsible for producing all aerobic energy"
"muscle fiber","aka, muscle cell"
"fascicles","bundles of muscle fibers. many of these are bundled together to form skeletal muscles."
"slow-twitch muscle fibers","muscle fibers that contract more slowly, and have higher aerobic endurance potential"
"fast-twitch muscle fibers","large muscle fibers that contract forcefully & quickly, but with limited aerobic potential"
"muscle fiber ladder","use either just slow-twitch (low intensity), combo of slow & intermediate twitch, or slow/intermediate/fast twitch (high intensity) fibers"
"calisthenics","body-weight exercises focused on exercising large muscle groups"
"strides","5-20s of 'fast' running, mimicking race paces (not sprints)"
"cardiac output","amount of blood heart can pump in a minute"
"capillarization","aka, capillary growth"
"sucking wind","when you engage additional muscles (abs, internal intercostals) to help exhale faster during intense exercise"
"diaphram","one of muscles used for breathing; contract to inhale, relax to exhale"
"oxygen uptake","extraction of oxygen from capilaries, bringing them into muscle fibers, and using them to make aerobic energy"
"organelle","subcellular structure that performs a specialized task"
