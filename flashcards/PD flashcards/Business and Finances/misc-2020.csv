"Demand creating","Marketing channels like TV, DM that generate demand"
"Multivariate Testing (MVT)","Measuring interaction effects between independent elements to see which combination works best. Best for small tweaks/changes, as a learning tool. Requires a lot of traffic."
"Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)","Collection of statistical models that compare the means between three or more groups."
"T-test","Type of inferential static to determine whether significant difference between means of two groups."
"Fractional factorial design","When testing multiple factors, focus on main effects & lower order effects (e.g., only 2-way interactions)"
"Multiple comparisons problem","The more inferences are made, the more likely erroneous inferences are to occur"
"Full factorial design","When testing multiple factors, test all combinations to provide full interaction insights. (Requires more traffic.)"
"Valuation","Process of estimating the potential market value of a financial asset or liability."
