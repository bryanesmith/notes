CAP theorem,"in presence of network partition, choose between consistency and availability"
Event Sourcing,pattern where persist change in state of entities as a series of atomically produced immutable events
Stream Circuit Breaker,pattern leveraging fault events to delegate handling of unrecoverable errors
Trilateral API,pattern where leverage 3 APIs: 1) synchronous for commands & queries; 2) async for publishing events; 3) async for consuming events
API Gateway,"creates barrier at boundary of system by pushing cross-cutting concerns, such as security and caching, to edge of cloud"
Command Query Responsibilty Segregation (CQRS),pattern where consume events from upstream components and create materialized views for local consumption

two-phase commit (2PC),"distributed transaction protocol made up of two distinct phases: 1) vote, 2) commit"
change data capture (CDC),database design patterns for automatically triggering actions based on data changes
Command Sourcing,lesser-known pattern where record inputs to command
Circuit Breaker,"pattern where a remote call is wrapped, and the circuit is open (automatically error without calling) when a critical failure threshold is reached"
AWS CloudFront,the AWS managed CDN service.
Database-First Event Sourcing,"bariant of Event Sourcing where data is storied in database first, and rely on change data capture (CDC) to push events to stream"
Offline-first database,"Pattern where persist events client-side in local storage, and publish to cloud whenever connected, which is stored as materialized view."
AWS Cognito,"AWS managed SSO, including SDK with offline sync capabilities."
Micro Frontend,Architectural styles where independently deliverable frontend applications are composed into a greater whole.
Postel's Law,"AKA ""The Robustness Principle"". Be conservative in what you send, liberal in what you accept."
SendGrid,Popular API-driven managed email service
Event-First Event Sourcing,Variant of Event Sourcing where event is first published to event stream and subsequently stored to database.
HighlandJS,Popluar streaming JS library
Event Collaboration,"Pattern where independent components consume relevant events & publish events in uncoordinated manner, which leads to event type coupling."
Event Orchestration,Pattern where leverage mediator component to orchestrate collaboration between compnents without event type coupling.
event type coupling,happens when modifying event schema or names requires updating consumers.
Command Message,"Events specifically intended to trigger a specific process, as opposed to just declaring that something happened. (This is common in Event Orchestration, where mediator outputs events intended to trigger specific processes.)"
Saga,Pattern where use compensating transactins to undo changes in multi-step process.
BASE model,"Alternative to ACID for distributed transactions. Basically available, soft state, eventually consisten."
Sinon.JS,Popular JavaScript test double library.
component testing,Testing that verified that a component produces desired behavior while still isolating from neighboring components. Happens one level higher than unit testing.
VCR library,"Integration testing library that procide a recording mode to fetch and cache remote responses, and a playback mode for testing via cache."
contract testing,"Asserting that response or event matches expected payload, often user consumer-specified tests and assertions."
transitive testin,Coordinating series of integration & contract tests together across teams to create an e2e test out of isolated tests.
Pact,Popular consuemr-first contract testing tool for HTTP and message-based integrations.
Tech Radar,ThoughtWorks publication on technology trends that comes out every six months or so.
Supertest library,"JavaScript library providing HTTP assertions via a fluent API, leveraging Superagent library."
Replay testing,JavaScript library for recording & replaying HTTP responses.
Mocha,"Very popular JavaScript BDD testing framework, with strong async testing support."
baton-request-relay,JavaScript library that reads Replay VCR recordings for use with contract testing.

Starts Per Second (SPS),KPI used by Netflix for monitoring their application. Measures how frequently customers are clicking the play button.
TestOps,"Discipline of managing the operational aspects of testing within the SDL; including planning, management, control, and insights."
real-user monitoring (RUM),End user applications sample performance data in real-time & periodically submit this info for tracking purposes.
Synthetic transaction monitoring (STM),"Generate a regular, consistent, and deterministic flow of traffic in production, generating signals that we monitor in our KPI, allowing us to continuously and predictably monitor health of system."
telemetry,Transmitting observations & measurements to the monitoring system for processing.
StatsD,Popular open source telemetry agent developed by Etsy.
WAF,web application firewall (acronym)
Strangler Pattern,Pattern leveraging External Service Gateway to route traffic to legacy system & slowly replace it with cloud native systems. Relies on event interception and asset capture.
