"fitting","find coefficients for model"
"scoring","Using model (including coefficients) and data to predict"
"null test","A/A test. Useful for identifying issues in deployed testing systems."
"primacy bias","when new variant in A/B test at disadvantage because experienced users unfamiliar (e.g., nav changes)"
"novelty bias","when new variant in A/B test at advantage due to newness, and not necessarily to usefulness"
"Hawthorne effect","observer effect. Individuals modify aspect of response due to awareness of being observed."
"bucket system","randomly assign users to buckets, then assign buckets to experiments"
"carryover effects","same users impacted by prior experiment are used in followup experiment, impacting behavior unrelated to test conditions"
"p13n","personalization"
"regularization","Mathematical cost term that discourages overfitting by penalizing large coefficients"
"Three sources for creating synthetic control","1) Time series data of response prior to intervention; 2) Time series that were predictive of target series prior to intervention; 3) Bayesian prior knowledge about model parameters"
"Difference-in-differences designs (DD)","Estimate the difference b/w pre-post diff in treatment group and pre-post difference in control group"
"state-space models","Models that describe the probabilistic dependence b/w latent state variable and observed measurement (i.e., how given system state translates into measurements)"
"structural time-series models","state-space models for time-series data"
"autocorrelation","correlation b/w elements of a series and others from same series separated by given interval"
"matrix decomposition","Methods that reduce matrix to constituent parts to make it easier to calculate more complex matrix operations. AKA, matrix factorization."
"Cholesky decomposition","Reduces symmetric matrix into lower-triangular matrix which, when multiplied by it's transpose, produces the original symmetric matrix. Useful for efficient numerical calculations, e.g., Monte Carlo simulations."
"Markov Decision Processes (MDP)","Used to find stationary policy that decides which action to take for given state in stochastic environment, ignoring previous states."
"exogenous factors","Factors happening outside a system."
"endogenous factors","Factors happening within a system."
"slates","AKA, asset choreography. Combination of multiple assets, the interaction effects of which result in combinatorics of action space."
"Andrej Karpathy","Taught famous Stanford class on neural networks; director of AI at Testla"
"ReLU","max(0,x). Good default choice of activation fn for neural networks because overcomes vanishing gradient problem."
"Kubeflow","Google-led k8s platform to streamline ML Systems, including various operators, pipelines, hyperparameter tuning, etc."
"Chainer","Open Source deep learning framework written in pure Python on top of NumPy and CuPy in 2015. Currently in maintenance only."
"MXNet","Apache Deep Learning framework"
"PyTorch","Python-based open source lib developed by Facebook AI Research lab."
"XGBoost","Multi-language gradient boosting framework."
"Seldon Core","Open source platform for rapidly deploying ML models on k8s by converting them into REST/GRPC microservices."
