"fitting","find coefficients for model"
"scoring","Using model (including coefficients) and data to predict"
"power","probability of correctly rejecting null hypothesis when it's false"
"confidence level","probability of failing to reject null hypothesis when it is true"
"null test","A/A test. Useful for identifying issues in deployed testing systems."
"primacy bias","when new variant in A/B test at disadvantage because experienced users unfamiliar (e.g., nav changes)"
"novelty bias","when new variant in A/B test at advantage due to newness, and not necessarily to usefulness"
"Hawthorne effect","observer effect. Individuals modify aspect of response due to awareness of being observed."
"bucket system","randomly assign users to buckets, then assign buckets to experiments"
"carryover effects","same users impacted by prior experiment are used in followup experiment, impacting behavior unrelated to test conditions"
"prior","probability expressing one's belief prior to taking evidence into account"
"posterior","probability of unknown quantity, treated as random variable, conditional on evidence provided"
"p13n","personalization"
"stratified sampling","Randomly sampling from subpopulations independently. Avoids bias introduced by pure random sampling."
"regularization","Mathematical cost term that discourages overfitting by penalizing large coefficients"
"Three sources for creating synthetic control","1) Time series data of response prior to intervention; 2) Time series that were predictive of target series prior to intervention; 3) Bayesian prior knowledge about model parameters"
"Difference-in-differences designs (DD)","Estimate the difference b/w pre-post diff in treatment group and pre-post difference in control group"
"state-space models","Models that describe the probabilistic dependence b/w latent state variable and observed measurement (i.e., how given system state translates into measurements)"
"structural time-series models","state-space models for time-series data"
"autocorrelation","correlation b/w elements of a series and others from same series separated by given interval"
"region of practical equivalence (ROPE)","range around null hypothesis that indicates equivalence"
"highest density interval (HDI)","Area under probability curve equivalent to some percentage (e.g., 95%). Can fall within or outside defined ROPE."
"matrix decomposition","Methods that reduce matrix to constituent parts to make it easier to calculate more complex matrix operations. AKA, matrix factorization."
"Cholesky decomposition","Reduces symmetric matrix into lower-triangular matrix which, when multiplied by it's transpose, produces the original symmetric matrix. Useful for efficient numerical calculations, e.g., Monte Carlo simulations."
"Posterior Predictive Checks (PPCs)","Simulating replicated data under fitted model and comparing these to observed data. Used to assess whether models give valid predictions of reality."
"stratification","process of dividing members of population into homogenous subgroups before sampling"
"poststratification","method for adjusting sampling weights, usually to account for underrepresented groups in population"
"Markov Decision Processes (MDP)","Used to find stationary policy that decides which action to take for given state in stochastic environment, ignoring previous states."
"Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)","Determine parameters of model to maximize likelihood that the process described by the model produced the observed data."
"exogenous factors","Factors happening outside a system."
"endogenous factors","Factors happening within a system."
