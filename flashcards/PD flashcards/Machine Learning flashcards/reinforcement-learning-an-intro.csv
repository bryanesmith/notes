"Richard Sutton, Andrew Barto","Two authors of Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction"
"Two most important distinguishing features of RL","trial-and-error search, delayed reward"
"Four main subelements of RL system","policy, reward signal, value function, model of the environment"
"policy","Mapping from perceived states of the environment to actions to be taken; may be stochastic"
"reward signal","Immediate, intrinsic desirability of environmental states"
"value function","Long-term desirability of states"
"model-based methods","RL approaches that use models and planning"
"model-free methods","Simpler RL approaches that fully rely on trial-and-error"
"greedy action","Action with greatest value"
"back up","After taking greedy move, current value of earlier exploratory state is updated to be closer to value of this later state"
"Law of Effect","Thorndike, 1911. Rewards strengthen connections, punishments weaken connections."
"basic credit-assignment problem","How do you distribute credit for success among the many decisions that may have been involved in producing it?"
"non-associative","When learning doesn't involve more than one situation"
