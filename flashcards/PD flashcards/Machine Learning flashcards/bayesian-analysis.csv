"power","probability of correctly rejecting null hypothesis when it's false"
"confidence level","probability of failing to reject null hypothesis when it is true"
"prior","probability expressing one's belief prior to taking evidence into account"
"posterior","probability of unknown quantity, treated as random variable, conditional on evidence provided"
"stratified sampling","Randomly sampling from subpopulations independently. Avoids bias introduced by pure random sampling."
"region of practical equivalence (ROPE)","range around null hypothesis that indicates equivalence"
"highest density interval (HDI)","Area under probability curve equivalent to some percentage (e.g., 95%). Can fall within or outside defined ROPE."
"stratification","process of dividing members of population into homogenous subgroups before sampling"
"poststratification","method for adjusting sampling weights, usually to account for underrepresented groups in population"
"confidence interval","Frequentist approach. Interval constructed to estimate unknown fixed value."
"credible interval","Bayesian approach. Capture uncertainty about true parameter by imposing prior distribution."

"homoskedasticity","Assumption of homogeneity of variance across all random variables."
