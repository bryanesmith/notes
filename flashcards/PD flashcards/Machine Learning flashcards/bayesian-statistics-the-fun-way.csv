"use case: binomial distribution","distribution used to calculate prob of certain number of successful outcomes, given number of trials and prob of success."
"binomial coefficient","(n k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)"
"binomial distribution formula","B(k=|success|; n=|trials|, p) = (n k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)"
"inference","process of figuring out probability given data"
"use case: beta distribution","distribution used to calculate prob of event based on observed success and failure counts"
"beta distribution formula","Beta(p; α=|success|, β=|failures|) = p^(α-1) * (1-p)^(β-1) / beta(α, β). Integrate to find probability of range."
"conditional probabilities","P(A,B) = P(A) x P(B|A). Does not assume independence."
"Bayes theorem","P(A) * P(B|A) / P(B)"
"Bayes theorem: prior","When solving P(A|B), this is P(A). (Our belief before seeing any data.)"
"Bayes theorem: likelihood","When solving P(A|B), this is P(B|A). (The data we observe.)"
