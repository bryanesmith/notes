"Roger Bannister","Broke four-minute mile in 1954"
"glycogen","stored carbohydrates. Body runs low around 90 minutes of running."
"periodization","seasonal approach to running w/ distinct phases; e.g., base training, strength-building, competition, recovery. works well for elite runners."
"lactate threshold","intensity level at which anaerobic energy production begins to negatively impact performance"
"anaerobic energy","energy created within cells without oxygen, created when body needs energy faster than body can produce with oxygen"
"VO2 max","maximum amount of oxygen your body can consume within a minute"
"running economy","how efficiently you use oxygen at give pace"
"lactate","fuel used by muscles to create aerobic energy"
"stroke volume","how much blood your heart can pump with each beat"
"even splits","maintaining same pace for each running split"
"negative splits","picking up pace during later splits in run"
"tempo run","sustained run (10-40 min+) at 'comfortably hard' pace you could maintain at least an hour"
"fartlek","Swedish for 'speed play'. unstructured blend of different paces aimed at challenging both aerobic and anaerobic fitness."
"age grading","in race, each runner's finish time is scored as a percentage of maximum performance expected based on runner's age"
"mitochondria","cellular structures responsible for producing all aerobic energy"
"muscle fiber","aka, muscle cell"
"fascicles","bundles of muscle fibers. many of these are bundled together to form skeletal muscles."
