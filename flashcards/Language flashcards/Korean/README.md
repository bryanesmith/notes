# Korean Flashcards

## About

Contains Korean vocabulary and grammar stored in CSV. There are no headers for these CSV, but if there were, they would be:

```
Korean,English

These can be imported into [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

These are not intended to be comprehensive for the resources suggested by the file names; these are only the words I'm interested in studying.
