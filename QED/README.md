# QED

by Richard P. Feynman

## Introduction to the 2006 Edition

by A. Zee
pp. vii - xx

* **Erwin Schrödinger** and **Werner Heisenberg** independently invented quantum mechanics (xiv)
* **Schrödinger equation**: (1925) differential equation describing three dimensional wave function of quantum mechanical system (xiv-xv)
* The **wave function of a particle**: intensity at point proportionate to probability of particle being at given position
* **Heisenberg uncertainty principle**:  the position and velocity cannot be simultaneously known (xv)
* Dirac-Feynman path integral formalism
* **Schrödinger**, **Heisenberg**, and **Dirac-Feynman formalisms** of quantum mechanics are all equivalent (xvi)

## Chap 1 - Introduction

pp. 3 - 35

* **Quantum electrodynamics** (**QED**) - study of the interaction between light and charged particles (4)
* **Maxwell's equations**: unifying equations between electrical and magnetic phenomena (electromagnetism) (4)
* quantum mechanics supplied theory behind chemistry (5)
* **Partial reflection**: Calculating the likelihood of light reaching sensors by bouncing off or penetrating one surface of glass (17-22)
* One surface of glass reflects light 4% of time, but two surfaces reflects light between 0-16% (average of 8%), depending on the thickness (22)
* How to calculate probability of multiple distinct events by adding arrows (25-6)
* **Probability amplitudes**: the square of length of the vector is the probability of event (25-6)
* Why light reflecting from very thin glass surfaces to detector is nearly zero: arrows nearly cancel out (28-9)
* Probability of reflecting off glass' two surfaces follows periodic pattern based on thickness of glass (29-31)
  - Light is reflected by matter inside glass, not by surfaces; but this is a useful mathematical trick, as explained in chapter 3
* **Iridescence**: the partial reflection of white light by a material of unequal thickness, partially reflecting different colors differently (33-5)

## Chap 2 - Photons: Particles of Light

pp. 36 - 76

* **Diffraction grating**: reflective surface with negative bias removed, reflecting white light into different colors (48)

## Chap 3 - Electrons and Their Interactions

pp. 77 - 123

* **Interference**: the wave nature of particles (e.g., photons) can reduce or increase rate of reaching detector when two holes, depending on spacing (79-80)
* Behavior of particles going short distances is weird; not necessarily straight, and exhibiting interference (85)

## Chap 4 - Loose Ends

pp. 124 - 152
