# QED

by Richard P. Feynman

## Introduction to the 2006 Edition

by A. Zee
pp. vii - xx

* **Erwin Schrödinger** and **Werner Heisenberg** independently invented quantum mechanics (xiv)
* **Schrödinger equation**: (1925) differential equation describing three dimensional wave function of quantum mechanical system (xiv-xv)
* The **wave function of a particle**: intensity at point proportionate to probability of particle being at given position
* **Heisenberg uncertainty principle**:  the position and velocity cannot be simultaneously known (xv)
* Dirac-Feynman path integral formalism
* **Schrödinger**, **Heisenberg**, and **Dirac-Feynman formalisms** of quantum mechanics are all equivalent (xvi)

## Chap 1 - Introduction

pp. 3 - 35

* **Quantum electrodynamics** (**QED**) - study of the interaction between light and charged particles (4)
* **Maxwell's equations**: unifying equations between electrical and magnetic phenomena (electromagnetism) (4)
* quantum mechanics supplied theory behind chemistry (5)
* **Partial reflection**: Calculating the likelihood of light reaching sensors by bouncing off or penetrating one surface of glass (17-22)
* One surface of glass reflects light 4% of time, but two surfaces reflects light between 0-16% (average of 8%), depending on the thickness (22)
* How to calculate probability of multiple distinct events by adding arrows (25-6)
* **Probability amplitudes**: the square of length of the vector is the probability of event (25-6)
* Why light reflecting from very thin glass surfaces to detector is nearly zero: arrows nearly cancel out (28-9)
* Probability of reflecting off glass' two surfaces follows periodic pattern based on thickness of glass (29-31)
  - Light is reflected by matter inside glass, not by surfaces; but this is a useful mathematical trick, as explained in chapter 3
* **Iridescence**: the partial reflection of white light by a material of unequal thickness, partially reflecting different colors differently (33-5)

## Chap 2 - Photons: Particles of Light

pp. 36 - 76

* When particle reaching sensor, the parts of the reflective surface contributing most is central part where paths of particle take almost same time (45)
  - The ends of mirror (where times vary greatly) contribute little to no probability of event
* Can place reflective surface in places where all paths basically cancel out (46), but you can remove segments of the mirror that result in negative areas of particle's arrow, and light will reflect (47)
* **Diffraction grating**: reflective surface with negative bias removed, reflecting white light into different colors (48)
* Light traveling through water, bending because it travels slower through water than air (50-1)
* Mirage on hot roads is a quantum effect of light from sky traveling more quickly in hot air near the ground (52)
* Why light appears to travel straight (53-4)
* As slits decrease in size, particles stop going straight (55)
  - This is because the number of possible paths to each detector decreases, and hence the differences in time each path can take also decreases (meaning alternative paths to sensors don't interfere as much)
  - This is a manifestation of the uncertainty principle, and is intuitively understandable using path integrals
* Quantum explanation of how lens works (57-8)
* Compound event probabilities are calculated by multiplying arrows (shrink and turn) (59-61)

## Chap 3 - Electrons and Their Interactions

pp. 77 - 123

* **Interference**: the wave nature of particles (e.g., photons) can reduce or increase rate of reaching detector when two holes, depending on spacing (79-80)
* Behavior of particles going short distances is weird; not necessarily straight, and exhibiting interference (85)
* :star: Three basic interactions account for all phenomena except gravitation and what goes on inside a nucleus: (85)
  1. photons move
  2. electrons move
  3. photons emit/absorb photons
* In one dimensional space, an **interval** (**I**): `I = (X_2 - X_1)^2 - (T_2 - T_1)^2` (88)
* Light doesn't always travel at the speed of light; amplitudes for different speeds, which really on matter for small distances (89)
* **Coupling**: amplitude of an electron to emit or absorb a photon
* Photons and electrons can move backwards in time (97)
* **Positron**: positively charged electron moving backwards in time (98)
* Every particle has an amplitude to move backwards in time, and therefore has an **anti-particle** (98)
* Photon is its own anti-particle (98)
* **Scattering**: when an incoming photon is absorbed by an electron, and a new photon is emitted (101)
* **Stimulated emission**: photons tend to move to same location as other photons, which is an outcome of quantum interference (112)
* **Exclusion principle**: aversion of two electrons to occupy same space (112)
* How lithium metal conducts electricity (113)
* **Insulators**: elements that don't easily lose their electrons (120-2)
* Polarization of photons and electrons (120-2)
* Spin 0, spin 1/2, spin 1, spin 3/2, spin 2 polarizations (121-2)
* **Field**: quantity that depends on position in time and space (123)

pp. 124 - 152
