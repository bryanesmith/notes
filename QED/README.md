* **Erwin Schrödinger** and **Werner Heisenberg** independently invented quantum mechanics (xiv)
* **Schrödinger equation**: (1925) differential equation describing three dimensional wave function of quantum mechanical system (xiv-xv)
* The **wave function of a particle**: intensity at point proportionate to probability of particle being at given position
* **Heisenberg uncertainty principle**:  the position and velocity cannot be simultaneously known (xv)
* Dirac-Feynman path integral formalism
* **Schrödinger**, **Heisenberg**, and **Dirac-Feynman formalisms** of quantum mechanics are all equivalent (xvi)
