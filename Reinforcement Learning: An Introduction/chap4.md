# Chapter 4: Dynamic Programming

* **dynamic programming**: collection of algorithms that can be used to compute optimal policies given a perfect model of the environment as a Markov decision process (MDP). (73)
* The RL techniques covered in this book will be attempts to achieve much the same effects as DP, only with less computation and without assuming a perfect model of the environment. (73)
* The key idea of DP and RL is the use of value functions to organize and structure the search for good policies. (73)
