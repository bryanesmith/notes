## 101: What is the Cloud?

* **IaaS** (infrastructure), **PaaS** (platform), **SaaS** (software)
* **Rails** (verticals of services) and **tiers** (horizontals of same type)

## 102: Scalability and costs in the Cloud

* Think **operating expenditures**, not **capital expenditures** (upfront costs).
* Usually cheaper to use AWS services than building your own services on EC2 instances (but understand their limitations)
* Benefits: new services, economy of scale, autoscaling, regional servers, high availability

## 103: Cloud impacts on Architecture

* Leverage services wisely; buy rather than build
  - Know costs for each (e.g., storage and bandwidth)
  - EC2 probably main cost; minimize always-on
* Modularize heavily; use provided services wherever posible
* Know each service's limits
* Multi-AZ deployments for HA
* See AWS whitepapers for relevant architectures

## 104: Creating a cloud account with AWS

* Use email address that can be shared across organization
