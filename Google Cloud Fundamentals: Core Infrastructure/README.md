# Google Cloud Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure

## Introducing Google Cloud Platform
* 4 kinds of services: Compute, Storage, Big Data, Machine Learning
* This course will focus on compute, storage, and networking
* **Zone** (e.g., europe-west2-a)
* **Region**: collections of zones with fast interconnections (e.g., europe-west2)
* **Multi-Region**
* As of today (2021/08/18), total of 27 regions and 82 zones
* View [cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/) for more details
* **Cloud Bigtable** (Apache HBase API), **Cloud Dataproc** (Hadoop as managed service)
* **Budgets & Alerts** (fixed limits, or metric like % of prev month's spending), **Billing export**, **Reports** (visual monitoring), **Quotas** (rate quotas, allocation quotas)
