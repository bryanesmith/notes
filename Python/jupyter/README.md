# Overview
* Form of **literate programming**, proposed by Donald Knuth in 1984:
  > Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.
* Grew out of IPython project, which is an interactive shell with features like code completion and syntax highlighting
* Automatically rendered in GitHub; however, interactive features won't work, in which case you can use nbviewer

# Commands
```python
%matplotlib inline # show images in notebook instead of separate window
```

# Resources
* [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/): for rendering web-accessible notebooks
* [Working with Jupyter Notebook files on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/working-with-jupyter-notebook-files-on-github)
